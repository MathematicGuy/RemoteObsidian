# [[Search Problems]]
**Conclusion:** Path Finding Algorithm can apply to every Algorithm that want to **search/find the Best Outcomes/Values by calculate steps ahead**  . (Like in Graph, Tree Structure problems type)
	Ex: Find the Best choice in the Chess game.

# [[Knowledge]]
**Conclusion:** Turn Human Logic into Computational/Machine Logic. So that we teach AI to Think on its own and Solve/Guess real world logical problems.  

# [[Uncertainty]]
*+ use statistic to guess what more likely to be happened.*
*+ Baysian model: how a particular event can relate to other events. How this value relate to that value (base on distribution)*
**Conclusion: So that our AI can can make inferences  based on what it already know.**
