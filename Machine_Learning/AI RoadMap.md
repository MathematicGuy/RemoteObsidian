To become an AI engineer, you need to learn a variety of skills, including:

- **Computer science:** AI engineers need to have a **strong foundation in computer science**, including *data structures, algorithms, and software engineering.*

- **Mathematics:** AI engineers need to have a **strong understanding of mathematics,** including *linear algebra, calculus, and statistics.*

- **Machine learning:** Machine learning is the **core of AI**, so AI engineers need to have a deep *understanding of machine learning concepts and algorithms.*


- **Deep learning:** Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that is used to **train artificial neural networks**. AI engineers need to have a good *understanding of deep learning concepts and algorithms.*

- **Programming languages:** AI engineers need to be **proficient in programming language**s such as *Python, Java, and C++*. These languages are used to **develop and deploy AI systems.**

- **Cloud computing:** AI engineers need to be *familiar with cloud computing platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP*. These platforms are used to **host and deploy AI systems**.

In addition to these technical skills, **AI engineers also need to have strong problem-solving and analytical skills**. They need to be **able to work independently and as part of a team**. They also need to be **able to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical audiences.**

Here are some specific courses or topics that you might want to study to become an AI engineer:

- ***Introduction to computer science***
- ***Data structures and algorithms***
- ***Software engineering***
