Use and mis-use of data
- collect and applied data at once. Not waiting data to be collect then use later.

+ More data better than less, but is it the right type of data
Data is messy -> AI team solve this
	Data problems
		Incorrect labels
		missing values
Multiples types of data
	images, audio, text -> unstructed data
