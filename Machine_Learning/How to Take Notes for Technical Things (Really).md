# Taking Notes is a WASTE OF TIME When You're Learning To Code! DO THIS INSTEAD
### 1. Don't Bother taking notes for the first 2 months rather focus on the course or tutorial. 
### 2. After learning the basics, start building projects and comment on every single line.

### 3. Write documentation, basically explaining the purpose of your project.
**(watch other tutorials on how to write documentation in VScode)** 
### 4. Only take notes of those concepts which you use very often and find it difficult to remember them.


Note is for self-explaination and documentation
Don't note it if you don't take them frequently. 
If you're a Beginner at sth, Learn by doing.
