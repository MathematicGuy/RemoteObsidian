>Don't start your company and learn by doing, Find a company with some kind of success and learn from them first. Since most likely everyone in that company is smarter than you. Surrounded by great people, learn what is smart and start a business.

**Prestige** (goes back to a **French word for Illusion and Latin word for playing trick)**, go to the place that have good result, not good places where you can't see good with your own eyes.
	Ex: Student might choose a highly prestigious university, like Harvard. However Harvard excels in many fields, it might not have the strongest AI research program. 


**High Urgency, High Iteration rate, you learn the most** if you just have that urgency to move faster.

Everything just come down to people (remind me of ESL)
	Keep everyone have oppotunities to growth
	Keep everyone happy
	Keep everyone to be there

Don't just work in a company for like 1 years, you really want to understand sth from first principles which required spending multiple years. What you learn is by solving that hard problem (e.g. when the company fail and how to fix it kind of problem)   


**The First Principle Thinking**
Keep asking why ? until you get to the root of reason ? 
Keep asking for better solution ?
Keep digging and you'll find some very interesting thing
