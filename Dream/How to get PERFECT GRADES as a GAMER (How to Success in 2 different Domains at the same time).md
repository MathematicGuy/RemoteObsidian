## 1) Sleep
> **Prioritize Sleep above everything else**. The best medicine for enhance your focus and creativity. (If you have time to play, you have time to sleep)
+ This mean **No substaince that can disrupt your sleep**

## 2) No caffeine, alcohol or any substance that can disrupt your performance -> Improv Sleep 
+ Only consume caffeine before 1h30 PM. 
+ Too tired even after 7hr of sleep

## 3) No gaming after 6pm -> Improv Sleep
>No Excuse, no gaming after 6PM. Because when playing LoL your brain goes in Fight or Flight mode which cause a lot of stimulant. It will disrupt your sleep. 

## 4) Concept of "Focus days" (Deepwork by Cal Newport)
> Only doing 1 activity per day.  Power stay in 1 Context (prove by neuron science)
+ This is the time and work saver that allow me to enjoy my life.
+ The compound effect you made in the day are much larger than 3 days may combine.
	
+ If you want to focus on 1 subject, focus on it until it done. Because all the knowledge you learn are more accessible. Your brain can just switch from league to studying right away right. 
	
+ Do the hard work when your cognitive level are high (in the morning/night for example) Do easier work latter. 
	+ If you decide to play rank, there're no point in playing a competitive video game if your brain not in the best state. 
	+ If you lose, you have to spend another 40 min or 1 hour to maybe get back what you need. The game look more like a gamble. Ex: losing 2 games in a row, it time to do other stup boii.
	+ Further more, the more awareness you are the more knowledge and experiences you gained after one game. **Don't add noise to the data**


## 5) No cutting corners in assigned tasks
> Super Important. Read the whole documentation before going in/working. It like coding something without understanding it (How can it even work right?)


## 6) Allow yourself to be bored
> You don't need to doing stup at all time to get the most of your time. Suprise, doing more only lower and lower your productivity.
+ Creativity & Original Thinking Strive from boredom. Bored time help your brain to re-think what it consumed and process it. It might be you rembering that one algorithm you learn last week and ways to applying it.
+ Before Sleep your brain also bored so it will recall what happened in the day, resulting in you no get that quick and nice sleep. So being bored solve this problem too. 

> If you playing league, playing league. Don't Liten to music or doing anything else. like they say: **If you work, work. If you play, play. If you eat, eat.**

## 7) Working together VS. Working alone
Study Alone, share together. After you have consume knowledge, share it with a friend/chatGPT to check sure of what you learned. 
> **Make sure what you learn, learned.** 

Ex: ask chatGPT to ask you question about the thesis/document you've read.
