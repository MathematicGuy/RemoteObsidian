Money is Power
ppl give bank $ -> bank loan money to invest bc bank need money to pay back -> infinite money if the bank can just loan like that.

Bank often lend money to business but back then there was king, but king have power so sometime they don't pay back. To migate this risk,
-> Merchant/Bank work together to kill the King and get the money back. This system ultimately become the central bank (through generation marriage, old stuff). 
-> Central Bank have power. And its can print money. 

So why do we have poverty if we can just give money ?
Scacity ? ppl waste food everyday. 
Because money is the real motivation to make people work like e.g. ppl seen poorer ppl and doesn't want to be like them so they work to be rich. No one would work if they already have everything they want. 

To make ppl work and for the people in power to build more wealth -> create artificial misery (making ppl want more) e.g. parant often say if you don't do well you gonna be like that poor person. 

Poverty create illusion that money valuable, "Poverty isn't what you do to yourself it's what the powerful DO TO YOU."
+ ? what crisis do ? to destroyed wealth when there too many of them. Now there scacity again, time to create value again -> more work. 
	same as you would play genshin if you already max out everything.
-> the real value is the work we do, so they create scacity to make us work. 

**Hapiness** backthen is community, is sharing and helping other like friends and family. 


**World View effect on Power**
**God** (Fate, Anger, Apollo, Pride, etc..) **vs Science** (Synapse, Memory, DNA. Environment, etc..)
+ 1st view made us know we have no choice in this life thus we just enjoy the most of what we can. 
	+ give more information & assessment of how the world really work. 
	+ **Eudamonia:** the king have power bc the god choose him, you have no option -> the point is to live the best of your life today, seize the day. That how you gain favour from the god. **The point of life is to live the best of your ability. Flourist.** 
	 -> Even though the 1st view made us feel like we have no countrol of ourselve and agency, **its push us to really enjoy what we have, to enjoy the best in our ability**  
	
+ 2nd view made us depent on the situation and ourselve because we always think we are the problem.
	+ Rather than flourist. As creative ppl we often ask ourselve how can I not feel sad, how to enjoy my life today. **This mindset Ensalve us** 
	-> Though we free to make decision but we then become so **depent on what should life be (at best) that we forgot to enjoy what we have now.** 
	
	e.g. If you feel sad you should seek therapy or do drug, video game while everything you need is take a walk -> more need more money to generate -> more market. 
	


Nation State made us Dependent because we feel
+ more responsible to determine our life -> hence powerless because we blame ourselve not the system. (Need more argument)
+ more dependent to the system, example when you sad school ask you to seek psychology not going for a run or physical activity.
	+ **Brainwashing:** For young children, in the acient greek country like Sparta, Aztect and Prussian they all have free education & war is what they have in common, they all prepare for war -> take children far from their parent so they are less likely to ask question while the teacher is the only one they could trust -> teacher always right 

You not getting brainwashed if you have no worried of asking question. 


### How Society Collapse

Cycle of wealth and power. 
Average -> Noble. So they want to have as many kids as possible to pass down their wealth -> this lead to too many people in power but none of them wanted to work -> so they hired migrant to work for them -> but migrant create culture instabiility. 

(High class is the Boss) - (Middle class is the manager) - (Lower class is the worker)
To create more wealth ppl in power need citizen work harder -> exploit the worker class -> to avoid confrontation they use war as a form of distraction.
