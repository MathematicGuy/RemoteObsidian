**Memory Clarity (clear brainfog)** -> Drinking water right after waking up. 

**Memory Auto** -> Take a nap after studying help retrain hard earned information better. 

**Stress debuff hack** -> touch grass for 5 minutes.

# CRAMMING for EXAM
## Phrase 1: Prioritize your Study Topics
![[Pasted image 20250508102747.png]]

## Phrase 2: Speed Learn
Study in the way that yeild maximum return per hours. 

Speed learning cycle 
### 1) Initial Question 
Reading through as many question to understand what they're testing. 
Practice 5 - 10 questions 
-> Understand the question context (retrieval) + textbook context (retrieveal source)
	
### 2) Skimming
"**Only** learning the ways that the information can actually be **tested**"
 *Skimming the topic 10 minutes to understanding what are the tested topic are.* 
(so basically like understand what you learning (the basics) before learning sth, or understanding the overview like "What are ABC before learning what ABC represented for")

3) Find out what the topic is about
4) What sections this topic is split up into
5) Find which parts of the chapter link into the questions you just read. 
-> The goal of this step is to help your brain feel like it already knows the shape of the topic. 
	
### 3) Learning (just for P1 Topic)
If you actually had a foundation of what this topic was you'll be able to understand the answers from each and every question a lot quicker. 
(**The Important of understand the full reading passage context first**) 

1) **Read all information in layers**![[Pasted image 20250508104030.png | center ]]

2) **Compare in your head between concepts and topics -> help you to memorize better bc its force your brain both materialize & analyze the information.**    
	NOTE: *materialize concepts or topics* mean *make abstract ideas more concretem visible or understandable*-essentially turning something theoretical into something tangible or practical. 
	e.g. In education: A teacher might **materialize the concept of gravity** by doing a demonstration with falling objects.

3) **Create a rough mindmap that combines multiple topics and links them memorably on a single page.**  

4) **Recall is much effective if you understand you already.** 
	![[Pasted image 20250508114001.png]]

  + ! If **TIME** is **SHORT**: **DO NOT MAKE NOTE WHILE YOU'RE LEARNING THE CONTENT**. 
  + $ Broken the lecture into a **mindmap**, create heading, add different concepts into each heading (only **add the important concept that I need to remember**)

### 4) Full Question Session 
**"Make use to every mistake that you make to the maximum."**
1) Writing down every mistake you make on a "Red topic list"
2) When answering each question, think broader than just the question (itself) - this mean connecting ideas
3) Go and learn from the wrong asnwers
	Back to Step 4) Learning. -> Layering that specific concept -> comparing between concepts in that topic. 

## Phrase 3: Review 
+ $ Retention Review System
1) **Targeted spaced reviews**
	recall a specific topic. 
	*The 48-Hour Rule* (minimal recall): don't let 48 hours pass before you review the weak topic again -> recall the topic today or right tomorrow. (basically space recall)
	Day 1, Day 4, Day 14
	
2) **Daily mixed-question sessions**. 
	After you have done your learning, do 50, 100, etc.. *mixed questions from all of the week topics that you've done before.* -> help your brain retrieve information much more flexible, your retrieval ability is tide up to any certain topic.  




# Learn Language Fast
Here’s how it generally went down: Students would sit in a comfortable, relaxed setting—sometimes even in armchairs, not stiff desks—to lower stress. 

The teacher would present the language material, like a list of foreign words or phrases, in a kind of scripted performance. First, they’d read the words aloud with exaggerated intonation—think dramatic pauses, varying pitch, and a confident tone—while the Baroque music (say, a slow Bach piece) played softly in the background. The music’s steady 60 BPM pulse was meant to sync with a calm heartbeat, keeping students in a chilled-out, receptive state. Then came the “active concert” phase: the teacher would read the words again, this time syncing the rhythm of their speech to the music’s beat. Students didn’t actively repeat or write anything—they just listened, letting the words wash over them. The idea was that the brain would soak it up unconsciously, like osmosis. After that, there was a “passive concert” where the teacher read the material more calmly, almost like a lullaby, while students relaxed even deeper—sometimes closing their eyes or leaning back. The memorization wasn’t about drilling; it relied on repetition through these readings, paired with the music’s soothing vibe, to lodge the words in long-term memory. Later, in follow-up sessions, they’d do playful activities—like role-playing or singing—to reinforce what stuck, but the core was that initial listening experience. Lozanov believed this tapped into a natural learning ability we all have when we’re not overthinking.
