Problem -> often forgeting the mindset, goals, and reasons. Why? bc of stressful life -> Solution: Create a system that I can maintain high or at least considerable amount of Motivation and not Forget why I'm doing this.

" You don't raise to the level of your goals, but you fall to the level of your systems "
