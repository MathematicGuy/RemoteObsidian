**How to check your bias and check misinformation**
> Thing that are 100% true, can not be true. For example, breastfeeding prove to improve child IQ more than those who don't. However, breastfeed is quite difficult, because the mother often need to have family support, this mean the child have good parental background. Good parental background lead to smarter child.

>The same for "Breastfeeding lead to low IQ, it often be the mother financial situation rather than the milk itself".

**Black-and-white thinking**

+ Ex: Fat name fat because they're fat? and protein built muscle. Therefor I mustn't have fat -> misleading, bc fat is your body backup energy source.
