You are driving along in your car on a wild,
stormy night. You pass by a bus stop,and you
see three people waiting for the bus:
1. An old lady who looks as if she is about to die.
	
2. An old friend who once saved your life.
	
3. The perfect man (or) woman you have been dreaming about.

Which one would you choose to offer a ride
to, knowing that there could only be one
passenger in your car.

Think before you continue reading. This is a
moral/ethical dilemma that was once actually
used as part of a job application.
