# LONG-TERM MEMORY
Apart from practicing and memory trick, how can you push that knowledge to long-term memory even more. 

How and when to review ? How to Retain it.

**2 Crucial Question.**
1) **Should you review to stop forgetting ?**
	re-reading is useless. There a experiment in Harvard where 3 groups of students was tested after an lecture. The 1st do nothing, the 2nd re-read what they learned, 3rd conducting question answering on leture content. The result are the 1st and 2nd group score almost the same while the 3rd group score significantly higher. The moral of the story are, **testing yourself is more effective than passive reading.**  
	1) Test yourself -> Help expose your weak points. Efficient focus on what need to be targeted. 
	2) Check what you gone wrong -> Revise targeted memory and add them to long-term mem. 
	+ ? This is because **re-reading naturally allow you to focus on know and passively ignoring what you dont', giving you a false sense of mastery.**
	
2) **How often should you train your memory ?** (How to Keep it in your Brain)
+ $ **Blank Page Strategy**. Write down all the targeted knowledges on a Blank Page and check your knowledge once you done. **Demainding but Effective** 
+ $ **Answer Question** Method. Quiz yourself, quiz eachother with a friend or chatbot.
+ $ **Multiple-Choice Quiz**  
+ $ **Space Repetition**, This method aim to remembering right when the forgeting curve begin. 
	1st review within 1 hours of learning.
	2nd review is a day later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
	3rd review is gonna be 3 days after the 2nd,
	4th review gonna be a week later
	5th review 2 week later. and so on and so on. 
	**With each review the forgeting curve get flatten**. Your knowledge retain longer and need to revised even fewer. **Effective but Tough to apply**
