### Part 1: Identity Shifting and Persona Fatigue
**Identity Shifting** (fake it till u make it)
	Being -> Doing -> Having 
	Collective Unconscious (social norm/expectation)


**"It's only possible when you truly own who you are meant to be"** - act like who you meant to be (the person u want to be)
+ It feels fake and unnatural for you, but it will feel like the right thing to do.
+ You feel less drained at the end of the day
	**Why?**
		**Action:** Persona Fatigue -> being someone you're not.
		**Key:** Stop Suppression, stop judgement (allow yourself to be (negative, positive, accepting))

### Part 2: Learning to be Vulnerable & Authentic
E.g. Quazi &  Bullying -> Quazi hide them because he afraid of judgement.
For men their source of shame is weekness. for woman their source of shame was apparence.

**to be Vulnerability** express your emotion, your self without worrying others will look down on you. This will allow u in fact be more attractive and more open in relationship.
	e.g. show your vulnerability to your wife.

**Being** - "I am stupid, unable and am afraid" (this is Shame) 
**Doing** - "I did sth stupid and I will fix that" (This is Guilt)
-> Becareful with the label you created for your self, if you identify yourself as this, you can look yourself as this in your unconsious mind.
**Goal:** Not to just disidentify, it's to create conscious identification. 


### Part 3: Unleashing your shadow self,
**Exercise:** Create or Discover your Shadow side and bring it to light.
> + If you look into the abyss, the abyss look back at you. 
> + To be able to become who I am truly want, I must know who I am truly are.

> **Shame can never thrive in the place of empathy, the only way it can thrive is in silence and supression.** 
> + This is so true, one I accept the cringe side of myself, I no longer feel ashame by it.
