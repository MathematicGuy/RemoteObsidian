To Learn sth effectively your brain need at least 25-40% of unoccupied memory. That mean 20% for remembering (thing of this as Memory) and least 5-10% for processing that data (creativity, critical thinkings, etc..) (Think of this as GPU, CPU and RAM). 

Have a good night of sleep can enhance your ability to process all the informations you learned today into your own brain (literally). So prioritise sleeping.

If I dont understand sth. I want to re-read all of the infor and which sentence or what word I don't understand and find/review it definition.
Ex:
+ F [[inverse]] of y is the logarithm of y because **e to the logarithm of x is x** and **logarithm of $e^y$ is y
	I re-read this sentence and find out I subconciously don't understand what F inverse mean (inverse the result of the function).
