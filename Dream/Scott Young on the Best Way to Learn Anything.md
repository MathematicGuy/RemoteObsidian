## What is UltraLearning?
>Ultralearning is a **strategy** for **aggressive, self-directed learning**.

+ **Self-directed** means that, rather than waiting to pay for expensive tuition and tutors, you can take back control. **(tự học)**

[ Cách Học nhanh nhất chính là cách Thực Hành nó ] 
# 5 Lessons About Life and UltraLearning

### 1) The Hard Way is the Easy Way
(  Cách khó thật chất là cách dễ nhất, Trong đây Khó là khó làm chứ không phải là khó thực hiện. Nếu muốn, luôn có thể làm luôn. Ví dụ như là muốn học tiếng Anh thì cố gắng tạo ra môi trường có người nói TA để giao tiếp )


- Not enough Time, Maybe it's me ?

**Benny Lewis** - project fluent in 3 month 
	1st though -> that Bullshjt !!!
	Maybe he understand something that I don't 
Point: Not some magic trick but his entire philosophy about learning languages.
-> He was Fearless, **talking to foreign people although he just know how to speak just a few word.**
If you want to learn a language but don't speak it now or with yourself. It will create what called a **English bubble**.
	+ Its mean You and your surroundings (peoples, family, friends) don't feel to speak the language you're Learning. 
	-> Not allow you to pratice very often. Then in the end, forget about it.

What if you only trying to speak the language you trying to learn, The Moment you step out of the Plane/ House/ School.
	**The no English rule (no Native language rule).**
	sth that Counter Intuitive:
	**-> Althought our ability is very low but by learning this way. We Speak more Natural.** 

**Its isn't about Language learning. Its more about the Approached.** 
Think about the Goal & Project I have.
	**==> What would I do things, if Doing them well were what all that mattered**. 
	then The hard way might be easier than you think.



### 2) A Little Fear is Very Useful 
> Tự hỏi bản thân, có lẽ học cái này bằng 1 số cách khác sẽ Hiệu quả và Nhanh hơn. 
> 	Có lẽ thay vì học Đại Học thì tự học Khóa học trên Youtube.
 Maybe there were some places that you can learn things a little bit faster.

Fear and Stress help us to feel Excited -> When we Excited, we learn faster. Make things more enjoyable.

Choose a Topic that Hard enough to Learn thus its give us more Drive & Willing to do the Challenge more. 
	Hard enought means its just exceed your capability. (not a large amount) 

#### Why not an entire Degree
(Nếu bạn có thể tự học 1 Khóa học. Thì sao không tự học để lấy 1 Tấm bằng)
(Để việc học thực sự thú vị, trước tiên mình phải chọn thứ làm đủ khó và khiến mình hứng thú tr'c )

> When we can self-study a whole Course. It's moe Excited.

> The Goal that excited you, also excited others as well.

### 3. Feedback is Good (So Ignore Most of it)
**Listen too much Feedback make us Inconsistency.**
+ Rather use those feedback as a Bar to view your Consistency in Performance. 
	(Nhận Xét là tốt nhưng chỉ tiếp nhận có chọn lọc. Ko sẽ bị Loạn. Mình cũng có thể dùng số lg nhận xét như 1 thước đo khi mình Thuyết trình 
		(Ko tốt thì sẽ có Nhiều LOẠI feedbacks [Feedback nhằm vào nhiều lỗi/vấn đề mình gặp phải] khác nhau, Tốt thì các LOẠI feedbacks CHẶT CHẼ [Cùng nhằm vào 1 số ít lỗi/vấn đề mình gặp phải] ))


**Doesn't alway help** 
(Góp ý có ảnh hưởng xấu vì nó gây mất động lực. Dù thế cách duy nhất để cải thiện là tiếp nhận thêm những Góp ý)
+ Feedback may have many negative effect. Make listener feel bad and lose their motivation. 
	**Feedback is scary AND useful.**
	However to **get over its** we need to 
		**Get more feedback** (by stand on the stage )
	**But Filter the Feedback (Or Ignore when that isn't helpful)** 


**A story:** 
(Kiến thức trên trg chỉ là lý thuyết, chỉ có thực sự thực hành mới giúp mình trở nên có giá trị trong mắt của ll did he learn in school. He learn 4 years.

### **The Problem of Transfer** 

(Mình thực sự thấy vui nhất không phải khi mình đạt đc điều gì đó, mà là khi mình nhận thấy mình có Khả năng làm đc nhiều hơn - Human love to DO, creating, doing, interacting. Just doing make life more valuable)
(Why do I not realise even that I have experience)

> **If you Learn something Really well. You need to learn by doing the thing you want to get good at.**

When you want to learn sth. Just do it. DO it by Practice. Don't just learn by Theories.

Re-phrase
>You do Get Happy when you can do More.

Quote:
	" It wasn't so much that he felt great about learning public speaking but doing the Project made him rethink how we will approach any project in his life "
-> The point is: **" The Best moment in Life is not comming from when you get a reward but because you see the possibility for your future life Expanding.**

![[Pasted image 20230825132307.png]]
	It's the feeling when you learn the ground knowledge and see all the possibility you can make.

Why did I ever think that I have to go to school something well and if I could learn this what other thing I could learn.
	that I though were too hard or frustrating or difficult.
