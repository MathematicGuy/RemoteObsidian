## N Things We Wish We Knew Learning the Violin
### 0. Treat learning how to play a piece as if was trying to solve a puzzle or riddle.
Break the code piece by piece. It's about exploration, not repetition (*you learn when you correct your mistake after making a mistake, nothing change if nothing change*) Experiment constantly, don't just pay attention, pay *microscopic* attention to the body, instrument, and the mechanics, the physics that shape your sound and what happend when you change thing. 

Play like a scienctist. Get excited about discovering new ways of playing.
### 1. Learn in Cycle (efficiency)
40 minutes play, 20 minutes rest. Give your brain time to regroup.

Every profesional althele will confirm how crucial rest and days off are, this is just the same - more practice doesn't always better. Try **2 days learn and 1 day off** so it doesn't get overload. Must have at least 1 day off. 

### 2. Practice Diversity (efficiency)
**Don't play the same thing over and over again, your brain get saturated and progress stop**. Please play a random or different one everyday. Play a different scale everyday (As recommended by Flesch himself)

### 3. Playing the Violin is an eternal pursuit of reducing tension. 

**Like working out, warm up first.** Always start a plauing playing session with something slow and quiet with a long notes and fragile bow changes. It get you in the zone and you're less likely to rush thing later. 

If it doesn't sound good, something somwhere is clenched. Notice, relax and listen again. 

Sometimes the biggest leaps in your progress will happen after you don't touch the violin for a while. Like if you practice a nasty passage or shift 50 times a day for a week, and it still doesn't work, then you don't touch that piece for a month, play it again and boom, it's perfect. It really happens. Allow yourself that flexibility, give your brain time to rest and regroup. Occasional breaks is also how you don't get sick of playing, btw.

### Good Foundation

**Center of Gravity - at the middle finger, not the first finger.** 


#### 5. Resonant (Cộng hưởng)
resonant - mean the sound is not hard or compress, but more outward while remain soft at the same time. (answer: I don't know)
