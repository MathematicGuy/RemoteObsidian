**Goals:**
+ To Lock In (The Key to have everything I ever dream of)
+ To get that Big Determination and Sense of Purpose I have 

**Who am I back then ?**
> A kid with big dream that not afraid of anything, want to find the root of every problem he faces. Always strive to be the best of himself so much that he burn out each days. He the guy who define the demon, the desires inside himself, he swour to left everything behind to full fill his dream no matter it take.

**Who I'm now ?**
>Depend on others to take actions. See his dream vividly and consume motivation to live. Still have that inner child although can't feel it most of the time. Even though he figure ways to this goal but cannot take action while also have that drive like the child back then.

**Why I have so much resentment for my mother/parents?** 
> She don't keep her promise of puschase the Programming Course I've long desires. I don't want to continue the programming class because it too exprensive so I decide to study programming on my own. But my parent don't understand it, they refuse to encourage me learnning programming because I'm too obsess with it, the only thing that made me happy, that I'm good at and truly feel what life is. In other word, that feel like your happiness was taken always by the person you admired, the person you love the most for life till that moment. To put more oil in the fire, I'm cannot accept the fact of me stood behind my colleagues, I suppost to be the best. Time goes by, I cope the pain with variety of disrtractions just to let my dream and who I suppose to be drifting elsewhere. So much agony spike up on me that I cried each night with regret, blaming and hatred which nurture the resentment that have already flood my brain.
