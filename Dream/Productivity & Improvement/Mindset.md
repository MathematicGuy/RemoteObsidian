## [[Mindset of Successful Programmers]]
## To Think
> **See things in a wide Perspective. Don't forge Ideas in a frame.** 
> + Think out of the Box
> 	Always *try to sees what is beyond that*. Can it be more in any others way. 


## If there're anything you couldn't do or get even that you wanted it so much
+ The 1st solution is **"You have to allow it to happened"** 
	Try to **convince yourself** that you really want to do it and then try to **don't try.** Simple as it is, a habit shouldn't be force to do, it should be occur !
	+ Allow that thing to grow by creating an environment for it and nurturing it like your child. Allow it to happen by prioritizing your time for it, thinking about how you're going to do it, and investing in it..
To conclude, **the only thing that stop you is you**. Don't make up rules, regulations, excuses, when you want to do it, I do it when the time is come, etc... Give it some space, time and efforts then remember to **don't force it allow it.**

## Comparing yourself to others is the greatest way to kill yourself. But also it can be the greatest way to perfect yourself in the right mindset.
