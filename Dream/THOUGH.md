## Daily Note 5/5/2025
I try coding Hackerank Number Line Jump problems today after not understanding it so long ago. Turn out coding is not about code, its truly about finding where the porblems are and tackle it. I learn a lesson, before coding anything, define the problems and its edge cases, tackle the problems in pseudo code, figuring out if there still anything wrong. And the last thing, code.

## Daily Note 6/5/2025
Super excited to head out with Linh and her mom, get free coffee & stuff, chit chat with her, she still beautiful like the first day I met her. After hanging out, I push to the gym for abs tranning sections, I shouldn't tired out my bicep muscles as it was in the recovering stages. Head home super tired after the gym and play ReadyOrNot.exe and woah turn out my laptop got so freaking lag is because of its temperature, and maybe a bit Win11. Sleep at 12PM, quite an improvement.

## Daily Note 7/5/2025
Alarm ring at 7AM but sleep until 10AM due to stress, my god I need to straighen up my discipline. Head to school to working on IELST reading till 12h40-ish, doing a good job analyzing my though. At noon, I get distracted with my brain refusing to learn, struggling with SVD in understanding why U transpose  orthoganol matrix get eliminate while V doesn't. Head to the gym at 5PM feeling quite tired, I should wait until my arms recovered so I could go back to my workout routine.

## Daily Note 15/06/2025 - Factors of Stress
Stress Management is a unpopular topic in Vietnamese school. As I discover there are 2 main sources of stress, Externally and Internally. Internal pressure include expectation from themself for the tasks at hand and pressure from their subliminal mind pushing them to achieve their dream. External pressure come from peers pressure, parents demand, expectation and their enviroments consider its hazardous which leave them no room for empathy or talked to (e.g. bully, unhealthy).

To tackle mental stress, first we need to understand them, in a nut shell External Pressures are Their Problem and Inernal Pressure are Our (own) Problem, by viewing pressure in this direction we know that what is their can be dismiss while what is our cannot.

Resolving external pressure is simple, we can either finish the tasks that causing the stress or ignore it completly by distract ourself with entertainment while waiting for the stress to go always.

However for Internal pressure to be release its cannot be ignore. One need to stay really honest with themself because these stresses are embedded into their subliminal mind. This mean the only way to solve the problem is by accepting the problem cannot be solve or fighting for its every day.

Ability to Study (a Problem) = Ability to identify main problem and key points (_FIRST_)+ Memory to retain problems (for comparison between problems) -> where learning started (Compare information then give out personal opinion)
1) Define "what do I want"
2) Optional (if feasable) how do I want my note to be organized
3) Where can I retrieve information to get what I want fast

## Daily Note 22/06/2025 - The Important of Studying Strategy
To .... save TIME while creating more value to my life, duh.

Define what I want to study -> Prioritize what I want to study -> Organize what I will study -> Execution AS PLANNED.

Wait, isn't that the ONLY REASON why a person **DON'T UNDERSTAND the SOLUTION** is **because** they **DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.**
	The reason why I don't immediately understand LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN is because I don't understand the SPECIFIC PROBLEM each function solved.

**Efficient Linear Teaching/Learning**
+ $ **Avoid knowledge overloading** in 1 teaching session or chapter by going from smaller problem to bigger problem and unpacking more problems as we go -> give *more time for critical thinking and encourage creative solution.*
+ ? When ? when you *STARTED TO LEARN* a new subject.
+ ! Not so great if you only *Reviewing* the Subject and *Already Understand it.* That why Cheatsheet are great for Reviewing.

**Blog for Reviewing vs Blog for Reader**
+ Section -> distinct group of paragraphs
+ Part -> distinct ideas or a paragraph inside the Section.

As you study linearly, you can:
+ **method 0:** Write down your idea linearly and correct any misunderstood notes
	-> This way other reader can catch your thinking flow easily as/considering every problem get define and solve clearly.
	+ **0.1:** Then improve apply Method 1 after finish all your note.
	+ **0.2** Refine note for linear thinking.

+ **method 1:** Or you can Refine your notes and adding more information after each Section (i.e. bottom to top) which improve the transparency and logic for all the information before and after.



Is it saturday, Monsieur ? YES it's Lock In day. What I want to study:
**Saturday Evening**
+ AIO2025 SQL Core Knowledge and HW. (1h45 - 3h50)
+ AIO2025 OOP and Data Structure (4h10 - 6h15)

**Saturday Night,** read AIO "how python stack work" and Finish OOP Exercise week 3.
**Monday Morning (wake up early)**
+ AIO2025 OOP + Data Structure and HW (5h30 -> 6h30)
+ Breakfast (6h30 - 7h)
+ Activate Viettel Sim Card for Phone Number (7h - 8h30) then go to school
+ Startup HW planning, what to do, task management (9h10 -10h10)
+ Ask Quynh Anh about Ky Nang Bo Tro homework, what I should prepare for it, my experience after Xuan presentation.

### Ransom Note 1/7/2025
Một trong những sai lầm phổ biến nhất mà con người thường mắc phải là tưởng rằng: nếu mình đã nhìn ra vấn đề, thì người khác cũng phải thấy giống như vậy.

Khi bạn nhìn ra một điều gì đó — một bất công trong gia đình, một điểm yếu trong cách tổ chức công việc, hay một thói quen xấu của người thân — bạn cho rằng điều đó rõ ràng đến mức người khác cũng nên nhìn thấy như bạn.

Và nếu họ không thấy, bạn kết luận rằng họ cố chấp, bảo thủ hoặc thiếu hiểu biết. Nhưng chính tại đây, cảm giác khổ của bạn bắt đầu.

Bạn nghĩ mình đã đúng. Và bạn nghĩ cái đúng đó là hiển nhiên. Nhưng bạn quên mất một điều căn bản: mỗi người sống với một bản đồ nhận thức khác nhau. Và bản đồ chỉ là mô tả, không phải là vùng đất thực tế.

Điều bạn thấy rõ là vì bạn đang đứng ở một vị trí cho phép bạn thấy nó. Họ không thấy, không phải vì họ ngu, mà vì họ đứng ở một góc khác — nơi điều bạn thấy nằm ngoài tầm mắt của họ.

Giống như việc bạn đứng trên tầng 10 và hét xuống người dưới đường rằng: “Tránh ra đi! Đằng sau có xe chạy tới kìa!” Nhưng họ không thấy. Và thay vì cảm ơn, họ nổi cáu vì bị hét vào tai.

Nếu bạn thực sự muốn họ thấy, bạn phải xuống đúng chỗ họ đang đứng. Phải từ bỏ góc nhìn của mình tạm thời, đặt mình vào hoàn cảnh người kia, và dẫn dắt từ bên trong — thay vì áp đặt từ bên ngoài.

Người khôn ngoan không hét vào tai người khác điều mình thấy. Họ tìm cách dịch lại góc nhìn của mình thành ngôn ngữ người khác có thể hiểu, và chấp nhận được.

Đây là lỗi lớn của nhiều người học rộng hiểu sâu: Họ quên rằng hiểu biết là vô dụng nếu không thể truyền đạt. Càng biết nhiều mà càng không ai nghe, thì vấn đề không nằm ở độ hiểu, mà nằm ở năng lực kết nối.

Ray Dalio từng nói: “Nếu bạn đang đúng mà người khác không theo, thì bạn cần xét lại cách trình bày – không phải mặc định họ sai.”

Vấn đề không nằm ở đạo đức. Cũng không nằm ở tri thức. Mà nằm ở cách vận hành giữa hai bản đồ nhận thức không tương thích.

Không phải bạn sai. Nhưng đúng mà không thể khiến người khác muốn nghe, thì cái đúng ấy chỉ là một phiên bản cô lập. Mà đúng trong cô lập, thì khổ là chuyện hiển nhiên — không phải vì bạn thiếu may mắn, mà vì bạn hiểu sai cơ chế giao tiếp giữa người với người.

Muốn bớt khổ, trước hết hãy thôi nghĩ rằng mình đang nói sự thật. Thay vào đó, hãy học cách diễn dịch sự thật đó đúng cách — theo bản đồ của người khác, không phải bản đồ của riêng bạn.


Vì bản đồ của bạn chỉ có giá trị khi nó giúp được người khác tìm được đường đi trong thế giới của họ.

### Daily Note 3/7/2025

Anxiety came from Ignorant. That why *Effort kill Anxiety.*

Every moment is a new moment. We shouldn't condemn ourself, don't let past actions define what you doing right now, infact, it's just you drainning your mental energy with negative though. *Efftort overcome Fear.*

After letting go of my part, I just reliased I too letting what could happened, what might happened control myself, its like a chain pulling me always from being the best I could be.

Why we play games, entertain ourself with games, doom scrolling when we don't even like it. Simply, to escapse reality. A man doesn't get addicted because he want to, its because hes lonliness and have no body to shared his pain with, like they say *Connection kill Addiction.*

### Daily Note 10/7/2025
It's been 39 days since my father past away on the 1st of June 2025. Truly unbelievable that he past 4 days after the Ascension Day and Father Day, is this a sign of good fate or what ?  Is god real, is fate destined to be true ? If everything happend for a good reason, tell me god ? What shall I suppose to become ?

That evening at Hyatt Hotel Residency, I gone to buy bear for my father waiting him to came back to have dinner with us, without a warning, my mother call me "Come down the beach, your father had drowed". At first, I though like every drowed case, he would just survive, oh how naive am I at that moment, the survival percentage from drowning after the body been affected by water is 5%. After 10' min of running, I find my father surrounded by a group medic CPR'ing him for 10-15 minutes, all possibility run through my mind denial his situation cannot be badly, is that it, this couldn't be that severe right ? Everyone came back alive from drowning like the movies right ? ....then I see my sister crying, facing her back to my father with tear running down her cheek with a stranger standing by her side giving company. As soon as I call her, she run toward me and shoving her face with tears onto my belly, crying more louder than ever. I have so many questions in my mind, urging to ask what happend but how can I do so when my sister seems so in pain. That split second, I came to realize that 'her life cannot go down like this, not like me, how can I help her go through this'. Just when the situation cannot be any better, the ambulance came, taking my father along with my mother to the hospital, the moment I saw the ambulance coming feel like a slap to my face pulling me back to reality, life doesn't have mercy for anyone, everybody are equal.

I lead my sister back to our hotel room to calm down and make sure  her psychology wouldn't go past her limit by being as playful as I can, "though I wish someone also did the same thing to me at that moment". Time past, my father co-worker came up ours room to ask my sister questions about the incident, at first I thought "no way she would reacall those traumatic memory", lukily she look calmer when asked about what happend during the incident, after that, me and shes trying to eat what "suppose to be a happy family dinner", we even have lopster, ironically at time like this, even the most wanted food feel like water, my sister and I in no mood for dinner but we able push through.

After cleaning up the dishes, all I wish is to have my father woken up from the coma even for whatever price, I even ask god "please make my father woke up from the coma, I promised to wake up at 5AM to study every single day, anything that you want, I shall make it come true, I promise". How ridiculous, even I know god doesn't exist and fate wait for no one, but hope is the best thing I can do at time like this. Hope help me clear up my mind, slowly send me to sleep...3 Hours past like 3 minutes, suddendly *ring ring* my mom call me, my brother woken up me up for the call, without knowning any context I handle the phone with a upseting mood, that was at about 1AM, moment before she said "*your father is in critical situation*"............................................................"*I need you to gather all of your and his belonging*"......................................................."*Tonight, me and you will come back home (town), tell your brother to take care of your sister, they will be flying back home later tomorrow*".
*Comming back home*, I asked back, my mother response *yes, we'll be comming back home, to your father hometown tonight*. Then the call end.

WHAT DOES THAT SUPPOSE TO MEAN ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
"WhAT, but why, isn't he suppose to woke up and continues his recover right ? Critical situation, gather his belonging, isn't the treatment suppose to continues, why come back home, why why why, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING BACK HOME MEAN". It's feel like there floating balloons tide up to my chest, my mind clashes of either accepting the truth or keep being naive about the situation. Shocked by what I heard, yet I carefully packed ours belongings prepare to go right away. One the taxi ride, I was in a blank state of mind but still hoping and hoping what couldn't be reverse. Finally, I came to Da Nang central hospital to sees my father, with no information, I asked the nurses if she know where my father is...got now useful information but at least I got enough wifi to contact my mom I am here. In the warm early morning of Da Nang in the vacation season, I sat down, patiencely wait for that call from someone I know. A car come by, my mother no where to be seen, except for that is Mr.Son my father best friend at the company and 2 taxi drivers, "this gotta be a long way", I said to myself. He call me up, put ours suitcases to the trunk, I hop on the car we drove some distance and wait again.

About 10' later, a abulance come up and stop in front of us, finally I saw my mother walked down the car, right away Mr.Son help me bring the luggage down, still in disbelief I asks him again "*so, erm, we bring my father back home right ?*", he look at me pause for a short second before answer "*yes, we are bringing him back to his home town, come, bring your luggage inside the ambulance*". Without hesitant, I paced fast to ambulance while seeing my mom waited for me at the car door.  The truth doesn't lie, before my eyes the moments I walked up the door, is a man body bloated up like a ballon, blanket cover from toes to chest, with ventilator tube plug straight to his lungs through the oral path, even the mischief god couldn't cover my eyes from witnessing what happend to be my father. My heart skip a beat, but my face remain calm with acceptance, not a single thought or idea pop up, my mind again going blank. When we both sit down, she hold my hand, asked if I and my sister was doing fine, if everything prepared correctly, then she lean foraward a little bit and said  "*well, like what you saw, this is your father son, look at your father son*".....I space in silent, *yes* is the only thing I could say. Her hand move from mine slowly toward my father face, leaning his face in her palm with sorrow in deep within her eyes, she then holds my father right hand and said "*let go back home shall we, let me bring you back home, from now on you don't have to endure stress anymore, you've always want to retired so much, you can retired now, no more worrying, no more stress*".... there're tear forming up within her eyes but her mental state seems mature and calmer than I expect, maybe she had come to term with the situation. Looking back, knowning that my father once hold my mother hand like this when shes was in the coma from the traffict accident backin the day, i wonder if fate let mother live so she could also hold my father hand back when her time come.

### 25/7/2025: Is AI actually thinking if it have Intuition
Intuition is sth that you sense that cannot be teached to other, that what people say.

But, what if you can teach people a framework that develop their intuition. Like how scientist and mathematics stimulate THINKING in AI ?
-> If you can replicate the sense of intuition, or just approximate it. Does that mean Intuition can be teach ? or instead of asking how can I have their Intuition, asks what material that I need do develop their sense of intuition.

**Good intuition vs Bad Intuition:** with that same materials and resources, ppl with good intuition can invented and develop way more ideas in their mind. Again, *the "how can I have his intuition at this moment" is not what importance, its the "what can I do to develop my intuition to be closer to him or high as him".*

Then one day, you all came like 5 salvation angels pulling me back up, and lit up my Passion and Desire for learning again ...something I had loss since High School. This feels like a feaver dream, although I really have Living My Dream Life right now.

__More Thoughs and Grateful__

WOAH, there's so much positivety I really coudn't listed them all. Once again, thank you so much !!!

You’re truly that one friend whom I’ve been longing for — the one who dares. If money were created to buy happiness, then right now I'm the richest man alive

### 12/8/2025: Interesting Facebook Post:

Lưu ý, bài viết này không đơn thuần thuật lại lời của Bret Taylor, mà còn có cả góc nhìn cá nhân của mình.

I. Sự thành thật trong câu chuyện ta kể cho bản thân

Bret Taylor kể về một sai lầm chí mạng của ông ấy khi xây dựng FriendFeed.

FriendFeed là nền tảng để người dùng cập nhật tất cả những thông tin mới nhất, từ những người họ muốn kết nối, cho đến những trang blog họ theo dõi, những thông tin họ bookmark,…

Bởi vì hầu hết đội ngũ của FriendFeed là những kỹ sư từ Google, nên họ rất tự tin vào sản phẩm.

Trong khi hệ thống của Twitter thường xuyên sập, hệ thống của FriendFeed thường chạy ổn định 24/7.

FriendFeed còn là bên đầu tiên tạo ra nút like.

Tuy nhiên họ vẫn thua.

Lý do là bởi khi họ không có nhiều người dùng, họ vẫn đinh ninh rằng lý do là vì sản phẩm và vẫn đâm đầu vào cải thiện công nghệ lõi.

Trong khi đó, vấn đề không chỉ nằm ở mỗi sản phẩm.

Trên thực tế, với một mạng xã hội cập nhật thông tin, việc có người nổi tiếng sử dụng là rất quan trọng, vì đây là những người ai cũng muốn follow để cập nhật.

Trong khi Twitter thu hút được những người như Oprah Winfrey, Justin Bieber, Obama,… Friendfeed vẫn bỏ qua khía cạnh marketing để tập trung hoàn toàn vào sản phẩm.

Kết quả là Friendfeed trở thành một mạng xã hội nửa vời, để cập nhật thông tin thì không bằng Twitter, mà để kết nối thì lại không bằng Facebook.

FriendFeed thua là bởi họ đã quá dễ dãi trong câu chuyện họ kể cho bản thân. Vì họ là những người làm sản phẩm, rất dễ để họ đổ lỗi sự thất bại của mình cho sản phẩm.

Bret khuyên rằng:

*Khi tự hỏi lý do tại sao sản phẩm thất bại, đừng vội tin vào câu trả lời hiện ra nhanh và dễ dàng nhất trong đầu bạn, bởi đó khả năng cao là câu trả lời sai.* (Mình đang diễn đạt lại chứ không trích nguyên văn)

Không chỉ trong kinh doanh, mà trong cuộc sống cũng thế.

*Để tăng tốc độ học từ những trải nghiệm, bạn nên tránh gắn liền bản thân với bất kỳ “câu chuyện” nào.*

Nếu bạn luôn tự cho mình là người thông minh, khi người khác chửi bạn ngu, bạn sẽ bị sự giận dữ choán hết tâm trí, không còn đủ chỗ để tự hỏi “hành động nào của mình khiến người khác nói vậy”.

Nếu bạn tự cho mình là một người không giỏi toán, bạn sẽ mất đi cơ hội hiểu được bản chất của những hệ thống phức tạp như trí tuệ nhân tạo, hay vĩ mô hơn là quy luật tự nhiên.

Đối với mình, chỉ có một câu chuyện duy nhất mình chắc chắn khi kể về bản thân, đó là:

“Tôi là người ham học hỏi”.

Mình sẵn sàng làm nhận bất kỳ lời chửi bới nào, miễn là mình có cơ hội học.

II. Nhận lời khuyên

Bret chia sẻ rằng một trong *những lý do FriendFeed thất bại là bởi họ không nhận (hoặc không chịu nhận) lời khuyên từ những người ngoài cuộc,* những người sẵn lòng nói cho họ sự thật họ có thể không muốn nghe, nhưng cần nghe.

*Ngoài ý kiến của bản thân, lắng nghe lời khuyên của người khác cũng rất quan trọng, vì họ có thể giúp ta chỉ ra những điểm mù tư duy.*

Tuy nhiên, một câu hỏi cũng không kém phần quan trọng là:

“Chọn lời khuyên của ai để nghe?”

Có một sự thật trong 10 lời khuyên bạn nhận được, thường chỉ có một lời khuyên đáng tin cậy, còn lại là bullshit.

Ta cần chú ý rằng sự tự tin của người nói ra lời khuyên không có quan hệ nhân-quả với tính chính xác của lời khuyên đó.

Nhiều người nói năng lắp ba lắp bắp, nhưng nếu chú ý nghe sẽ thấy lời khuyên của họ thực có giá trị.

Trong khi đó, có những người nói năng mượt mà như gió thổi vào tai, nhưng nếu chú ý kỹ sẽ thấy lập luận có nhiều khúc gãy. Như kiểu mấy con LLMs như GPT hay hallucinate.

Một cách chúng ta có thể làm là tìm lời khuyên từ không chỉ một mà nhiều người khác nhau, sau đó tiếp tục lọc chúng qua 3 câu hỏi sau

1) Tại sao lời khuyên đó lại hiệu quả với người đưa ra lời khuyên. Bối cảnh của họ trong thời điểm đưa ra lời khuyên đó là gì. Một lời khuyên có thể hiệu quả đối với một công ty đã có quy mô triệu đô, nhưng chưa chắc hiệu quả với Start-up giai đoạn đầu.

2) Điểm chung của những lời khuyên bạn nhận được là gì? Nếu có một điều bạn nghe đi nghe lại từ nhiều người khác nhau, thường đó là một điều đáng lưu ý.

3) Lời khuyên đó có khiến bạn cảm thấy thoải mái không? Nếu có… bạn cần phải cẩn trọng vì có thể cảm giác thoải mái đó được tạo ra bởi “thiên kiến xác nhận” - bản năng tìm kiếm những điều tương tự với niềm tin sẵn có - của con người.

Thường những điều nào khiến bạn thấy khó chịu đều đáng để bạn dành thời gian suy nghĩ thêm.

Sau khi lọc những lời khuyên bạn nhận được qua 3 “phễu” này, bạn chưa chắc sẽ tìm được một lời khuyên hoàn toàn chính xác, nhưng ít nhất cũng tăng thêm ít nhất 60% khả năng.

*Mục tiêu không phải là tìm được một lời khuyên đúng nhất, mà là chắt lọc từ những lời khuyên ta nhận được.*

III. Cách tốt nhất để dự đoán tương lai là xây dựng nó

“The best way to predict the future is to invent it"

Đây là câu “khẩu quyết” yêu thích của Bret Taylor, và cũng là lý do ông tham gia vào tạo dựng rất nhiều doanh nghiệp.

Nếu bạn không biết, Bret còn từng là người dẫn dắt team tạo ra Google Map, cựu CTO của Meta, Cựu CEO của SalesForce, board member của Shopify, và Co-founder của Sierra.

Đây cũng là lý do dạo này mình học rất nhiều về AI, và tham gia một early-stage Start-up để đóng góp cho sự phát triển của họ.

Mình không muốn chỉ là người quan sát sự phát triển của công nghệ và nhân loại, mình muốn tham gia xây dựng một điều gì đó có ích cho xã hội.

Nếu chỉ ở nhà đọc sách và viết lách, mình sẽ bị thiếu đi góc nhìn thực tiễn, và kỹ năng thực hiện hóa những ý tưởng của mình.

Mình còn rất trẻ, còn rất nhiều điều cần phải học, nhưng mình sẽ không ngừng tiến về phía trước.

1) Avoid inactivity like sitting still for a long time.
2) Create focus enviroment, limiting screen time.
3)  Dont eat a lot of carb

For people with ADHD, consume *less carb* because food like *sugar paste, potatoes, rice, fruit and juice* -> increase seretonin -> make you happy
But *when seretonin counter balance dopamint, so seretonin increase then dopamint decrease*. (ADHD mean you lack Dopamint)

**Problems:** What causes Procrastination if it not procrastination itself. Contrary to popular belief, procrastinators are not under-motivated or lazy; rather, they often experience overmotivation characterized by two conflicting forces:
1) **Over-motivation:**
	+ **2 Conflicting** forces that dismiss eachother *a strong desire to succeed (approach motivation to be perfect in both tasks or deadlines, etc..) and a simultaneous strong fear of failure (avoidance motivation, don't want to do the work or doesn't accept to sacrificed).* This dual motivation creates a psychological “stuckness,” where the *individual is caught between wanting to start and fearing the consequences of potential failure*. This internal conflict manifests as procrastination, which is often described as feeling stuck or immobilized despite being agitated and anxious.

2) 1 Force overwhelm another

2) 1 Force overwhelm another


**Example Story:**
Long story short: people procrastinate because they couldn't accept themselve to underperform, think about it, everytime you sacrificed sleep in order to wake up tomorrow just to come back to sleep again or when you have so many important things to do but can't accept the fact that your products aren't going to be perfect so you started to Delay until the end is near then you rush & end up with a imperfect product anyway. After that maybe u make an excused to protect your Ego.

In other word, ppl self-sabotage themself by increase life difficulty like sacrifing sleep to wake up early for deadline to save their self-image and social judgement. "If success is achieved despite procrastination, it reinforces their self-image as capable beyond expectations. This brinksmanship—thriving under last-minute pressure—is humorously noted as a defining trait of students at competitive universities."

Let analyze, sacrified sleep + delaying out of perfection + `[whatever reason]` -> All are Causing Stress. Maybe stress is the problem right, here are ways to reduce stress:
1) *Allow yourself to have a comfortable timewindows to do yourwork, NO CONSTRAIN, you DON'T have to FINISH your WORK NOW, you could save it for LATER*. This mean, it doesn't need to end up perfectly finished.
2) Change your perspective about your Deadline from being stressful to being thoughful for example, like they isn't going mad if you don't do your work, what the worst possible scenario :)) Then allow yourself like method 1.

**Strategy:** Detach performance from ability and ability from self-worth.

Why the life of a Person who living on the edge of Living and Dead radiate more life than someone having everything they wanted but still depressed. I one though it was greed or there nothing to pursue, but by applying the "life is simple but people make it hard" and "keep moving" rule [`1`](https://youtu.be/7l_0ZcSuRwg?si=j2irdBxFkZw6wMFW), turn out life only have meaning as long as you keep moving, no matter what, similar to what happened when a river stop flowing or information stop flowing, there nothing created & connect. Even if it was shit, having something is still better than standing still & do nothing. Or it just the combination of grit, spirit and kinetics.

After watching both of these videos, i see why the idea of freedom feels different depending on the world that raised you.
1) I Grew up in Russia. Here’s why we’re afraid of Freedom - https://youtu.be/4hqz1NRUPy4?si=ycifcaMAWyfGyFGK
2) I’m Russian. Here’s How Corruption Really Works - https://youtu.be/0B8AyBhwasI?si=enztCnOol9u-DoYk
I learned that how environment reevaluate how we or better to say Russian People look at freedom and actions. Being born in a newly form (kinda) communist contry, I do have a sense of corruption feel like, where Bride are nothing than a commodity for easy way out and a transportation to saving time from cumbersome work. For underpay workers, bride is a way to survive but this create a hiarchy that benefit mostly the rich at the top, thinking of your parent bride the teacher to have you more attention in class (if u a specific bad child that need more effort), at a perspective, bride is a way to show respect and appriciation to teacher's effort for their extra work, then for your teacher to have more chance for promotion/be in good term, he/she also bride school mangemer, then the manager bride the school supervisor to keep the school at its best, the ladder go on and on. 
+ *Corruption as a Necessity:* Because the "official" system is slow, broken and hostile, corruption becomes the "parallel transportation system" to help things run smoother (as we say, bride keep things moving).  
+ *Hiarchircal Complexity:* It is a "ladder" where everyone brides up and takes from below, to fasten their task -> Priority become a task to manage instead of job to get done. 
+ *Bride dismiss sense of trust:* when everything can be bride, trust only exists between individuals, not a group.

But for Freedom especially, the reason go far more complicated in Russia than the West. Like PTST, people who suffer from Chaos, Unstability for many years want sense of security, their enviroment force them to be alert all the time, even when they laugh, because when the system run with bride, trust is fragile and trust is the pillar of Democracy. Not like in the West where ppl are praise to take risk and support to fall on, Russian does not gaurantee that, its a place where being different say you are higher than other and taking "reponsibility/leadership" mean you will be the one blamed if thing go wrong. Therefor, political passivity "be with the group" is a rational survival instinct, not a sign of agreement.
+ *Environment require Cautions and Alert from child to adult*. "To understand Russians you have to understand how instability raises you... You learn to live under a certain weight not crushing not unbearable just constant like carrying a heavy coat everywhere after a while you forget you're wearing it."
+ *Freedom = Chaos*.  The concept of freedom carries the "memory of instability" and the fear of losing everything. Live the Soviet in the 90s, because the collapse of the SoViet Union is described not as liberation, but as a time of raw survival. This generational trauma created a "daily atmosphere" of instability, teaching children that "the ground you stand on may not be stable".
+ Unlike the West
	+ where Responsibility is empowering it means having trusted and stading up for other, in Russia its mean you are someone to blame if thing go wrong. 
	+ where Chaos is often linked to creativity, and unpredictability is seen as exciting, in Russia, Chaos synonymous with danger - the risk of "losing structure, safety, losing the ability to plan your life", in addition of the great SoViet collapse, the Russian mind sees it as a threat to survival. 

**Conclusion**
+ *Survival PTSD:* after century of instability and war, most of the older population is paralyze by the fear of sudden change. The asmosphere is heavy, children inherit constant alert composure from adult. *Russia teach survival quickly rather than freedom.* 
+ *Systemic Trap:* Russian base on Bureaucracy, Corruption is not a crime but the jeil to keep thing going fast & smoothly.
