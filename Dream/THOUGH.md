I try coding Hackerank Number Line Jump problems today after not understanding it so long ago. Turn out coding is not about code, its truly about finding where the porblems are and tackle it. I learn a lesson, before coding anything, define the problems and its edge cases, tackle the problems in pseudo code, figuring out if there still anything wrong. And the last thing, code.

Super excited to head out with Linh and her mom, get free coffee & stuff, chit chat with her, she still beautiful like the first day I met her. After hanging out, I push to the gym for abs tranning sections, I shouldn't tired out my bicep muscles as it was in the recovering stages. Head home super tired after the gym and play ReadyOrNot.exe and woah turn out my laptop got so freaking lag is because of its temperature, and maybe a bit Win11. Sleep at 12PM, quite an improvement.

Alarm ring at 7AM but sleep until 10AM due to stress, my god I need to straighen up my discipline. Head to school to working on IELST reading till 12h40-ish, doing a good job analyzing my though. At noon, I get distracted with my brain refusing to learn, struggling with SVD in understanding why U transpose  orthoganol matrix get eliminate while V doesn't. Head to the gym at 5PM feeling quite tired, I should wait until my arms recovered so I could go back to my workout routine.
