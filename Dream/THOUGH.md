## Daily Note 5/5/2025
I try coding Hackerank Number Line Jump problems today after not understanding it so long ago. Turn out coding is not about code, its truly about finding where the porblems are and tackle it. I learn a lesson, before coding anything, define the problems and its edge cases, tackle the problems in pseudo code, figuring out if there still anything wrong. And the last thing, code.

## Daily Note 15/06/2025 - Factors of Stress 
Stress Management is a unpopular topic in Vietnamese school. As I discover there are 2 main sources of stress, Externally and Internally. Internal pressure include expectation from themself for the tasks at hand and pressure from their subliminal mind pushing them to achieve their dream. External pressure come from peers pressure, parents demand, expectation and their enviroments consider its hazardous which leave them no room for empathy or talked to (e.g. bully, unhealthy). 

To tackle mental stress, first we need to understand them, in a nut shell External Pressures are Their Problem and Inernal Pressure are Our (own) Problem, by viewing pressure in this direction we know that what is their can be dismiss while what is our cannot. 

Resolving external pressure is simple, we can either finish the tasks that causing the stress or ignore it completly by distract ourself with entertainment while waiting for the stress to go always. 

However for Internal pressure to be release its cannot be ignore. One need to stay really honest with themself because these stresses are embedded into their subliminal mind. This mean the only way to solve the problem is by accepting the problem cannot be solve or fighting for its every day.  

Ability to Study (a Problem) = Ability to identify main problem and key points (_FIRST_)+ Memory to retain problems (for comparison between problems) -> where learning started (Compare information then give out personal opinion)
1) Define "what do I want"
2) Optional (if feasable) how do I want my note to be organized
3) Where can I retrieve information to get what I want fast

## Daily Note 22/06/2025 - The Important of Studying Strategy
To .... save TIME while creating more value to my life, duh. 

Define what I want to study -> Prioritize what I want to study -> Organize what I will study -> Execution AS PLANNED. 

Wait, isn't that the ONLY REASON why a person **DON'T UNDERSTAND the SOLUTION** is **because** they **DON'T UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM.**
	The reason why I don't immediately understand LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN is because I don't understand the SPECIFIC PROBLEM each function solved.

**Efficient Linear Teaching/Learning** 
+ $ **Avoid knowledge overloading** in 1 teaching session or chapter by going from smaller problem to bigger problem and unpacking more problems as we go -> give *more time for critical thinking and encourage creative solution.*  
+ ? When ? when you *STARTED TO LEARN* a new subject. 
+ ! Not so great if you only *Reviewing* the Subject and *Already Understand it.* That why Cheatsheet are great for Reviewing. 

**Blog for Reviewing vs Blog for Reader**
+ Section -> distinct group of paragraphs
+ Part -> distinct ideas or a paragraph inside the Section. 
	
As you study linearly, you can: 
+ **method 0:** Write down your idea linearly and correct any misunderstood notes 
	-> This way other reader can catch your thinking flow easily as/considering every problem get define and solve clearly. 
	+ **0.1:** Then improve apply Method 1 after finish all your note. 
	+ **0.2** Refine note for linear thinking.
	
+ **method 1:** Or you can Refine your notes and adding more information after each Section (i.e. bottom to top) which improve the transparency and logic for all the information before and after.  



Is it saturday, Monsieur ? YES it's Lock In day. What I want to study:
**Saturday Evening**
+ AIO2025 SQL Core Knowledge and HW. (1h45 - 3h50)
+ AIO2025 OOP and Data Structure (4h10 - 6h15)

### Ransom Note 1/7/2025
Một trong những sai lầm phổ biến nhất mà con người thường mắc phải là tưởng rằng: nếu mình đã nhìn ra vấn đề, thì người khác cũng phải thấy giống như vậy.

Khi bạn nhìn ra một điều gì đó — một bất công trong gia đình, một điểm yếu trong cách tổ chức công việc, hay một thói quen xấu của người thân — bạn cho rằng điều đó rõ ràng đến mức người khác cũng nên nhìn thấy như bạn.

Và nếu họ không thấy, bạn kết luận rằng họ cố chấp, bảo thủ hoặc thiếu hiểu biết. Nhưng chính tại đây, cảm giác khổ của bạn bắt đầu.

Bạn nghĩ mình đã đúng. Và bạn nghĩ cái đúng đó là hiển nhiên. Nhưng bạn quên mất một điều căn bản: mỗi người sống với một bản đồ nhận thức khác nhau. Và bản đồ chỉ là mô tả, không phải là vùng đất thực tế.

Điều bạn thấy rõ là vì bạn đang đứng ở một vị trí cho phép bạn thấy nó. Họ không thấy, không phải vì họ ngu, mà vì họ đứng ở một góc khác — nơi điều bạn thấy nằm ngoài tầm mắt của họ.

Giống như việc bạn đứng trên tầng 10 và hét xuống người dưới đường rằng: “Tránh ra đi! Đằng sau có xe chạy tới kìa!” Nhưng họ không thấy. Và thay vì cảm ơn, họ nổi cáu vì bị hét vào tai.

Nếu bạn thực sự muốn họ thấy, bạn phải xuống đúng chỗ họ đang đứng. Phải từ bỏ góc nhìn của mình tạm thời, đặt mình vào hoàn cảnh người kia, và dẫn dắt từ bên trong — thay vì áp đặt từ bên ngoài.

Người khôn ngoan không hét vào tai người khác điều mình thấy. Họ tìm cách dịch lại góc nhìn của mình thành ngôn ngữ người khác có thể hiểu, và chấp nhận được.

Đây là lỗi lớn của nhiều người học rộng hiểu sâu: Họ quên rằng hiểu biết là vô dụng nếu không thể truyền đạt. Càng biết nhiều mà càng không ai nghe, thì vấn đề không nằm ở độ hiểu, mà nằm ở năng lực kết nối.

Ray Dalio từng nói: “Nếu bạn đang đúng mà người khác không theo, thì bạn cần xét lại cách trình bày – không phải mặc định họ sai.”

Vấn đề không nằm ở đạo đức. Cũng không nằm ở tri thức. Mà nằm ở cách vận hành giữa hai bản đồ nhận thức không tương thích.

Không phải bạn sai. Nhưng đúng mà không thể khiến người khác muốn nghe, thì cái đúng ấy chỉ là một phiên bản cô lập. Mà đúng trong cô lập, thì khổ là chuyện hiển nhiên — không phải vì bạn thiếu may mắn, mà vì bạn hiểu sai cơ chế giao tiếp giữa người với người.

Muốn bớt khổ, trước hết hãy thôi nghĩ rằng mình đang nói sự thật. Thay vào đó, hãy học cách diễn dịch sự thật đó đúng cách — theo bản đồ của người khác, không phải bản đồ của riêng bạn.


Vì bản đồ của bạn chỉ có giá trị khi nó giúp được người khác tìm được đường đi trong thế giới của họ.

### Daily Note 3/7/2025

Anxiety came from Ignorant. That why *Effort kill Anxiety.* 

Every moment is a new moment. We shouldn't condemn ourself, don't let past actions define what you doing right now, infact, it's just you drainning your mental energy with negative though. *Efftort overcome Fear.* 

After letting go of my part, I just reliased I too letting what could happened, what might happened control myself, its like a chain pulling me always from being the best I could be.

Why we play games, entertain ourself with games, doom scrolling when we don't even like it. Simply, to escapse reality. A man doesn't get addicted because he want to, its because hes lonliness and have no body to shared his pain with, like they say *Connection kill Addiction.*

### Daily Note 10/7/2025
It's been 39 days since my father past away on the 1st of June 2025. Truly unbelievable that he past 4 days after the Ascension Day and Father Day, is this a sign of good fate or what ?  Is god real, is fate destined to be true ? If everything happend for a good reason, tell me god ? What shall I suppose to become ?  

That evening at Hyatt Hotel Residency, I gone to buy bear for my father waiting him to came back to have dinner with us, without a warning, my mother call me "Come down the beach, your father had drowed". At first, I though like every drowed case, he would just survive, oh how naive am I at that moment, the survival percentage from drowning after the body been affected by water is 5%. After 10' min of running, I find my father surrounded by a group medic CPR'ing him for 10-15 minutes, all possibility run through my mind denial his situation cannot be badly, is that it, this couldn't be that severe right ? Everyone came back alive from drowning like the movies right ? ....then I see my sister crying, facing her back to my father with tear running down her cheek with a stranger standing by her side giving company. As soon as I call her, she run toward me and shoving her face with tears onto my belly, crying more louder than ever. I have so many questions in my mind, urging to ask what happend but how can I do so when my sister seems so in pain. That split second, I came to realize that 'her life cannot go down like this, not like me, how can I help her go through this'. Just when the situation cannot be any better, the ambulance came, taking my father along with my mother to the hospital, the moment I saw the ambulance coming feel like a slap to my face pulling me back to reality, life doesn't have mercy for anyone, everybody are equal. 

I lead my sister back to our hotel room to calm down and make sure  her psychology wouldn't go past her limit by being as playful as I can, "though I wish someone also did the same thing to me at that moment". Time past, my father co-worker came up ours room to ask my sister questions about the incident, at first I thought "no way she would reacall those traumatic memory", lukily she look calmer when asked about what happend during the incident, after that, me and shes trying to eat what "suppose to be a happy family dinner", we even have lopster, ironically at time like this, even the most wanted food feel like water, my sister and I in no mood for dinner but we able push through. 

After cleaning up the dishes, all I wish is to have my father woken up from the coma even for whatever price, I even ask god "please make my father woke up from the coma, I promised to wake up at 5AM to study every single day, anything that you want, I shall make it come true, I promise". How ridiculous, even I know god doesn't exist and fate wait for no one, but hope is the best thing I can do at time like this. Hope help me clear up my mind, slowly send me to sleep...3 Hours past like 3 minutes, suddendly *ring ring* my mom call me, my brother woken up me up for the call, without knowning any context I handle the phone with a upseting mood, that was at about 1AM, moment before she said "*your father is in critical situation*"............................................................"*I need you to gather all of your and his belonging*"......................................................."*Tonight, me and you will come back home (town), tell your brother to take care of your sister, they will be flying back home later tomorrow*".
*Comming back home*, I asked back, my mother response *yes, we'll be comming back home, to your father hometown tonight*. Then the call end. 

WHAT DOES THAT SUPPOSE TO MEAN ????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
"WhAT, but why, isn't he suppose to woke up and continues his recover right ? Critical situation, gather his belonging, isn't the treatment suppose to continues, why come back home, why why why, WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY COMING BACK HOME MEAN". It's feel like there floating balloons tide up to my chest, my mind clashes of either accepting the truth or keep being naive about the situation. Shocked by what I heard, yet I carefully packed ours belongings prepare to go right away. One the taxi ride, I was in a blank state of mind but still hoping and hoping what couldn't be reverse. Finally, I came to Da Nang central hospital to sees my father, with no information, I asked the nurses if she know where my father is...got now useful information but at least I got enough wifi to contact my mom I am here. In the warm early morning of Da Nang in the vacation season, I sat down, patiencely wait for that call from someone I know. A car come by, my mother no where to be seen, except for that is Mr.Son my father best friend at the company and 2 taxi drivers, "this gotta be a long way", I said to myself. He call me up, put ours suitcases to the trunk, I hop on the car we drove some distance and wait again. 

About 10' later, a abulance come up and stop in front of us, finally I saw my mother walked down the car, right away Mr.Son help me bring the luggage down, still in disbelief I asks him again "*so, erm, we bring my father back home right ?*", he look at me pause for a short second before answer "*yes, we are bringing him back to his home town, come, bring your luggage inside the ambulance*". Without hesitant, I paced fast to ambulance while seeing my mom waited for me at the car door.  The truth doesn't lie, before my eyes the moments I walked up the door, is a man body bloated up like a ballon, blanket cover from toes to chest, with ventilator tube plug straight to his lungs through the oral path, even the mischief god couldn't cover my eyes from witnessing what happend to be my father. My heart skip a beat, but my face remain calm with acceptance, not a single thought or idea pop up, my mind again going blank. When we both sit down, she hold my hand, asked if I and my sister was doing fine, if everything prepared correctly, then she lean foraward a little bit and said  "*well, like what you saw, this is your father son, look at your father son*".....I space in silent, *yes* is the only thing I could say. Her hand move from mine slowly toward my father face, leaning his face in her palm with sorrow in deep within her eyes, she then holds my father right hand and said "*let go back home shall we, let me bring you back home, from now on you don't have to endure stress anymore, you've always want to retired so much, you can retired now, no more worrying, no more stress*".... there're tear forming up within her eyes but her mental state seems mature and calmer than I expect, maybe she had come to term with the situation. Looking back, knowning that my father once hold my mother hand like this when shes was in the coma from the traffict accident backin the day, i wonder if fate let mother live so she could also hold my father hand back when her time come.

Think I realize after marriage for 10 years: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/19oaDJ9E3C/
 1) The *Core* of the *Family* is ofcourse *MONEY*. 
 2) Marriage is your life biggest business. So sort your soul mate, one you with her, you do not leave her.  
 3) Marriage without Voice is worst than marriage without sex. Silent is not the answers.
	 forcing expectation on your love one
4) A man cannot make money, doesn't deserve marriage at all. (literally everyone)
5) Betwen humans, "seeing, empathy, loving, being together" is the result of one's sacrified (accept losing) Expect  

I have been long creating this habits where I would watching mindless video, doomscroll every time I get too tired. This is the biggest barrior between me and my bestself. Before my birthday, I will take back my life by trying my best. This time for once, I'll really living live.
