I try coding Hackerank Number Line Jump problems today after not understanding it so long ago. Turn out coding is not about code, its truly about finding where the porblems are and tackle it. I learn a lesson, before coding anything, define the problems and its edge cases, tackle the problems in pseudo code, figuring out if there still anything wrong. And the last thing, code.

Super excited to head out with Linh and her mom, get free coffee & stuff, chit chat with her, she still beautiful like the first day I met her. After hanging out, I push to the gym for abs tranning sections, I shouldn't tired out my bicep muscles as it was in the recovering stages. Head home super tired after the gym and play ReadyOrNot.exe and woah turn out my laptop got so freaking lag is because of its temperature, and maybe a bit Win11. Sleep at 12PM, quite an improvement.

Alarm ring at 7AM but sleep until 10AM due to stress, my god I need to straighen up my discipline. Head to school to working on IELST reading till 12h40-ish, doing a good job analyzing my though. At noon, I get distracted with my brain refusing to learn, struggling with SVD in understanding why U transpose  orthoganol matrix get eliminate while V doesn't. Head to the gym at 5PM feeling quite tired, I should wait until my arms recovered so I could go back to my workout routine.

Finally delete Steam to accept to dive into my academic carrer. To be happy I need to cut off what is me today, so that I can become that of me tomorrow. Tomorrow I will wake up at 5h30 and the first thing I do is practice IELST Reading.

## Daily Note 15/06/2025 - Factors of Stress 
Stress Management is a unpopular topic in Vietnamese school. As I discover there are 2 main sources of stress, Externally and Internally. Internal pressure include expectation from themself for the tasks at hand and pressure from their subliminal mind pushing them to achieve their dream. External pressure come from peers pressure, parents demand, expectation and their enviroments consider its hazardous which leave them no room for empathy or talked to (e.g. bully, unhealthy). 

To tackle mental stress, first we need to understand them, in a nut shell External Pressures are Their Problem and Inernal Pressure are Our (own) Problem, by viewing pressure in this direction we know that what is their can be dismiss while what is our cannot. 

Resolving external pressure is simple, we can either finish the tasks that causing the stress or ignore it completly by distract ourself with entertainment while waiting for the stress to go always. 

However for Internal pressure to be release its cannot be ignore. One need to stay really honest with themself because these stresses are embedded into their subliminal mind. This mean the only way to solve the problem is by accepting the problem cannot be solve or fighting for its every day.  

Ability to Study = Ability to identify main problem + Memory to retain problems (for comparison between problems) -> where learning started (Compare information then give out personal opinion)
1) Define "what do I want"
2) Optional (if feasable) how do I want my note to be organized
3) Where can I retrieve information to get what I want fast
