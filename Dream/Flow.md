Pushing through struggle is the key to flow. 

In simple term. When you see a Hill, Sprint. -> Reach Limit -> Step back 
-> Enter Release State:
	relax, subconcious mind to take over. take 10 min to do nothing. like drinking water.

-> Comeback -> Enter Flow 
-> Enter Recovery
	Consolidate memory after solving the problem or obsorbing the problem. Active recorvery like Ice Bath, Sauna and Sleep these activities all increase our static load which return u to baseline faster and boosts resilience. 
-> Enter Flow Afterglow (sastifying fatigue - tired but feel energetic bc u just solve a hard problem)
-> State of  ... : Calm and contentment
