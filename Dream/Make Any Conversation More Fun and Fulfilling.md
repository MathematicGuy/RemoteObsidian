## Why Question Matter ? 
[It doesn't hurt to ask: Question-asking increases liking](https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/Huang%20et%20al%202017_6945bc5e-3b3e-4c0a-addd-254c9e603c60.pdf)

**First Question to ask:** open ended question -> just avoid closes ended question like question with answers end up with *"YES"* or *"NO"*. Goes with question like *"What been exciting about your day ?", "You look great, how have you prepare for today ?", etc...

Question like "What are you looking forward to today ?" add directness with "you", positive emotion with "looking foward" and specific with "today". 

**Simple tactics to keep short conversation longer:** keep asking about the question, like if I ask "How was your day", she said "odd ?" then I would ask "how odd ?" This allow the conversation expand further.  
+ She: "I often go to school where my old friend gathered most"
+ You "that so wholesome, same. You must have many nice friend, right ?"
	
This might know as **Reflective Responses**, **re-asking** about the **question's situation**  like *"so this happended", "the bus / the cat"* also improve your understanding while its also help extending their talk. 

**Answers with summarisation:** If they shared a long ass story, first answers with summarisation could enhance your conversation experience, mutual understanding with key. 
	**Paraphrasing** - general idea. 
	**Summarising** - key points.

**Answers with feedbacks:** your talks could expand much more with observation. This include looking out for their 
+ **Emotions**: sad, angry, compassion, etc.. -> this call **Emotion Labeling**
+ **Behaviours**: are they distacted, confused, convern, hot or cold, etc.. -> **Behaviour Labeling**

**Ask them without accusing them:** *"you **seem** sad ?, let me bring you some water", "you **seem a little** confused, do you want to reheard it again", "you **seem quite** concern, what wrong?", "you sound tired ?" etc..* -> not "**you look sad**". The trick is keep the conversation in positive side, **don't judge, just describe how you feel using unfactual language**.
	note: unfactual mean not cosisting fact or accusing sth.
	
+ $ This can be quite unnatural without context so make sure you still you, be yourself while hovering these technique. In the end, making conversation more joyfull so, keep the authenticity of the converstation.  

Note: for some people, asking question about the past is much more relatable.
