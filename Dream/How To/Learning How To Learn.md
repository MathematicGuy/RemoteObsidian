**Procratination**
+ Occur when you do something hard (which slightly painful)
	+ So your brain redirect you from that material to sth fun (social media, food, etc..) ---temporarily but make you feel bad after.
-> Can be fix using **Pomodoro technique which encourage us to concentrate for a period time then rest**. (25 - 5) (60 - 30) 

**Practice Makes Permanent**
+ Easy subject are see-able (like a Pig, we see it, we know it)
+ Hard subject are abstract thus require imagine nation and deep understanding. (like Math having a lot of abstract sign and indication)
-> At first Math knowledge are just some f**aint neuron connection, by practice we help to strengthen those to concrete and pernament knowledge.**
+ Imagin your neuron like a freshly building wall. Each time you **place an amount of block**, you need to **leave it some time to dry out**, if not **that wall will be a mesh just like when u cramming.**

+ To help knowledge sticking to your brain, we use a technique called **Chunking** study which is **study bit by bit daily or a bit a week** as it help build up a steady and strong foundation.

**Introduct to Memory**
2 types of Memory
+ Working Memory (like RAM)
	Hold all current infomation
+ Long-term Memory (like Disk)
	save infomation for longer or permanent.


Ours memory are like a poor watercolor which can't really sustain for a long time.
	By **repeatition, it help the watercolor last longer** and vaporize to the air. **Then transfer it to our Long term memory.** 
+ In the mean time (waiting the color to dry - waiting infomation to process in our mind)
	**Go for a walk, shower, anything that allow your mind to relax anddart randomly around. -> can pop new Ideas**
	+ Space your learning section called Space Repetion

Long term memory is like a warehouse of canvas. Its can store billion of canvas and also minimals the drying process.

**Importance of Sleep**
	**By just being awake creates toxic products in your brain. To get rid of these poisons? We need to sleep.** YESSSS !
	+ Sleep help to **solve negative thought**
	+ Sleep help to **concrete our knowledge**
	+ Sleep help our brain cells shrink thus **increase the space between your brain cells and help to flush the toxin away.**
		Think of a steaming can of waters. The toxin flow out the air leaving the pure water behind.
Let get to  a *critical idea.*
	+ Taking a test **without getting enough sleep means you're operating with a brain that got little metabolic toxins floating around in it**.
	+ During **sleep and rest you are actually studying as your brain are tidying up ideas and concepts.**
		Sleep also shows to **make a remarkable difference in your ability to figuring out difficult problems** + **understanding what you trying to learn.**
	+ It like freeing up your forefront of your brain helps other areas of your brain start talking.
	+ Plus there a chance of you dreaming about what you're learning, hence improve you studying times.
-> Study help us learn new thing. Sleep and Rest us remember new thing. 

Don't multi-tasking. If you can try to focus on one thing first then switch your focus on the other.
Your brain need a moment of pause to process the infomation.
Surround your self with who you want to be
	Have other people around to bounce your ideas off of is a very important part of doing science.
