Our full body can only endure a lower amount. That mean every time I push a body part to it limit, I'm also pushing my body to the limit.
There for I if I try to push all of my body parts to its limit, I would be recorver from it. 
	Because Muscle gains from recorvery in other word when trainning we are tearing down ours muscle just to get more muscle in the recorvery phrase.

Applying this to life, I see that I often fail for a common trap which is go 100% for all areas of my life result in lower growing or even pushing my self back.

To improve my main skill and maintain others skills. I have to balance my side-skills routine. Like pushing myself more in a 2 days workout section then rest 1 day or more then repeat. 
-> By doing that, I actually pushing my self to grow further hence I put lazer focus on 1 task for an amount of time.

+ 
Lesson learned: Organize day to focus on each task for preminum grow in each areas of life. Don't push 100% on all areas, seperate them, balance them. Grow my main areas daily and maintainning others skills while doing that and put some day to grow that skill more while not disturb the grow of my main skill.

+ Priority Main Skill 
+ Mantainning Side Skill (not abandone them) - put MEV into them
+ For Areas I want to push beyond. Schedule a day to learn them along with my main skill.

-> Change my Workout Plan
-> Change what I want to learn schedule. Focus on them on 1 days
