**Comment:**
	I've been doing this intuitively for a long time. I also beyond-failure negative-only sets. For example in the triceps rope pull-downs, once you reach failure (no ability to pull the rope down anymore), use your body to sink down (squat or stay on one knee) and then rise up again fast, leaving your arms fully extended, then slowly perform the eccentric portion of the tricep pulldown (rope going up slowly and controlled using the triceps only).


### Partial Rep Variation + Empty your tank (staitamina tank in each excercise)
> Stretch your muscle and your form out so that it in full range of motion. Then lower your body to the lower -> Start from that position, do half motion rep. Just go half up then do them repeatedly.


## Lengthened Superset

> Do full range of motion until you reach the failure point (Full Range failure point) -> Continue doing PARTIAL REP Variation until failure.

### Benefits of Lengthened Superset

1. **Increased Muscle Tension**: By emphasizing the lengthened position, muscles experience greater tension, which can promote more significant muscle growth.
    
2. **Enhanced Flexibility**: Working on the stretched position can improve muscle flexibility over time.
    
3. **Time Efficiency**: Supersets in general save time by combining two exercises into one set without resting in between.
    
4. **Muscle Fatigue**: Lengthened supersets can lead to greater muscle fatigue, challenging the muscles more intensely and potentially leading to better muscle adaptation and growth.
