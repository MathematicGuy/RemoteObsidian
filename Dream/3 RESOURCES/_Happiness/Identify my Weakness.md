Compare myself to my college -> Feeling Peer pressure and not doing anything -> repeat and not doing even more thing.


People often strive for what they starve in the past
	like people who has love starvation in the past, often fall in love and have a stronger love constrain to people they love. Even if something was wrong logically and sprivitually.

Would I be happy If I don't sastisfied my idea of being the best within the people I know zone.
