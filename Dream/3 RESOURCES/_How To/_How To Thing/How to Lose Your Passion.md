+ By Not Focusing on your Passion 100% (a few hours a day)

+ To Find Out Why I am losing Passion for something I try to put all my passion into something else. And I realized that putting too many constrains on what I loved would turn it into what I hated. 
	+ The constrains are "how can I do it better ?",  "what are the more efficient ways to do it ?" and etcetera. But it turn out that investing more into what I love gradually makes it a burden.
	+ Why ? Because putting the best effort into what I love will create the Duty effect. The "I must finish it or else" feeling. Therefore, I turned what I wanted to do voluntarily into something somewhat obligatory.
