"Learning is like solving a puzzle, you have to break it down to pieces in oder to learn it"


**Why understanding concept help us to remember better?**
> When you read a document you're storing more memory. when you understand a document (conenct all the dots) you are optimizing that infomation leading to optimize the connection of the info that you have to remember. 
	-> instead of remembering 10 things, you can remember 1 thing that -> 2 things. And that 2 things can -> 5 things, and that 5 things -> 2 things. Therefor anytime you access that 2 last things you will revision all the 8 things that require to -> it, and for that 5 things, you will revision that last 3 things you learn before. 
+ Connection -> Revision is the key, that why when we understand stuff, we often remembering it more. Not because of you "understand it and how thing connect" but  because when you accessing those info, all the info leading to it get revise, thus make you remembering even more.
