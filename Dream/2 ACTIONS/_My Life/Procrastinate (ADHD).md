### < watch this if you always procrastinate >


## DO THE HARD THING FIRST
**" If doing math is the mental-ist thing to do. Well, then you should do it as the first thing in the morning "**   

Doesn't work -> maybe the problem is ME ?
Why it **not working for me? -> Only for others people?**
**That not the True:**
	After trying too much productivity method most people may diagnosis with ADHD.
	Most of them don't question their ADHD.

 Productivity -> most prof talk about neural typical brain (not ADHD)  -> ADHD most tips don't work with you.

##### NEUROTYVITY vs ADHD
**Motivation**
+ Neurotypical -> importance, consequences, reward
+ ADHD -> You know the deadline, but still struggle. 
	+ Bunch of task -> confuse
		+ Doing unnecessary part
		Even know that you know but you don't do it. and apply self-Stress.
	 => Solution: break down step -> too much step -> distractions
	  -> delay -> negative loop repeat (self-destruct)
	Problem are ADHD brain are Motivate by foresee :
			**CAPTIVATE** 
				trying something new. Do things in different way. 
			**CREATE**
				ADHD brain is very creative -> find what excite you (Seeable outcome)
			**COMPETE** 
				Love it, give the dopamine rush. Because it exist constantly.
		 **COMPLETE** (special power - edges runner )
			 Last day before test, Deadline rush. 
		**=> Power COME FROM THE MOMENTUM**


**Distraction**
So when I **find it hard to start**:
	I need to **pick 1 one the Foresee**.
		+ **Captivate**
		+ **Compete**
		+ **Complete**
Use 1 one the way to start Momentum.

**Overwhelm**
**Mindset**
	"None of these are going to work for everyone, and even the
	ones that for you, they're not going to work every time "

	" Take these and try them out, and if they work, use it while it works, and if it doesn't, put it down for a while and try a different method " -> can come back for it latter of course.

=> Don't invested too much into 1 method. Why? because ADHD brain doesn't like 1 thing, it's creative so it's hate the one tone kind of method.
=> Need to constantly changes.
**Embracing the Changes**

**Using time base goals -> outcome base goals.**
ex: learning a language -> plan an hour -> come to ADHD -> to chapter 5 and finding it difficult.
-> Because **ADHD brain not like to stick to the plan** 
-> **Set a time limit but you don't have to followed it.**
	*In 60 min I gonna study a language, I don't know how but I will.*

- Feeling difficult to study in the room -> Change the environment, leave for a while -> then com back latter.

+ Want to Reading a book a habit -> I gonna read 5 pages a day -> **Build the Momentum.** 

+ **Trying for a Habit -> Do micro commitment.**
	example: I will finish this exercise

Pomodoro -> Deadline (delusion) effect -> ADHD brain like that.
**Making it a Game** -> interesting. Can be Toxic with other -> *So why not compete with your-self (your past-self)*
**-> Aim for 1% better. At least you show up, constantly trying.**


Conclusion:
+ ADHD Brain **doesn't like One-Tone kind of things, needs creative.** You **need** to **constantly trying out different studying methods, environments, and experiences.**

+ To have the **motivation, ADHDs** need to **really feel the deadline**, then the **competition feeling and mindset**, and more importance Captivate which is **trying out new thing.** 
	=> To open these motivations. **First I must have the Momentum.** Because my brain **doesn't work well with complicated info.**
	+ **To Building Momentum, start with small tasks and goals.** Remember **don't getting too complicated**. Set **small goals and short-commitment**
	+ And if you **ever get bored** -> **change its**. *That may work for you but like always not for long.*
	
+ **ADHD love Competition and close to ass Deadline** -> Create a *metal environment using the POMODORO technique.* (deadline delusion)

#### => Expect the unexpected, Just constantly trying to improve. Even if it 1% you will be surprise how much you can accomplish.
