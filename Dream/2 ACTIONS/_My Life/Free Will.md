**What is Free Will**
> Free will is the concept of a individual have the ability to decide their own fate by not letting prior circumstant, causes or any divine intervention determined them.

> There are Free Will, Determinism, but what about  "a person don't have any will, someone who don't remember or care the prior of his/her act". 
+ To test if free will exist we need to test:
	+ 2 Identical person (individual) live in the same environment
	+ Observe how do they act?
	+ Same consequences? same outcome?
	+ If not Free will
+ Prior condition
	+ Understand how the brain work? (is it just if and else like machine)
	+ Ensure the enviroment is stable for both individual
	+ 2 Testing Chamber. Simulating 1 enviroment.
>Then Free will can be achieve right ? Since
>+ They're not output the same outcome even though we make them to (with the artificial env)

**Is there any way to escapse determinism ?** 
>Does someone must tell me in order for me to know that?
>It true that one can relized that if they see 1 system structure then project that structure to the society structure they live in **-> See the Matrix**
