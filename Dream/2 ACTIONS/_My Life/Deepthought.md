## You deserve what you're going through. You would rather become good tomorrow than be good today
>You suffered today because you choose to be better tomorrow
 
+ **Every single challenge/struggle I want to avoid. Asked my self to fight it in this present moment, not in the past, not in the future. The best moment is right now**.
	Small temptation can be overwhelmed me even if I let it go once. (true story, remove my electric devices addiction) 
+ When I say **"wait for the perfect moment"**..
	+ **then I've loss, that sentence mean I wouldn't do it unless there're no harshship**, if I make a changes and don't give up to it and act like the person I wanted to become. Then I have achieve success.
		
	+ **It a lie, there're no perfect moments. This is the moment, Think in the moment**
+ People who invents excuses to get out of situation have a very convoluted mind (tâm trí phức tạp)
	when they get catch up in a lie (by themselves) cuz they in a place that they said they wouldn't be so if they come across this person now they'll be found out and they have to keep up all these scenario that they've made up to all these situations to all these differents people and they can't even sleep quitetly at night.

**Whatever you want to become, what you want to do down from the smallest behaviour to the biggest virtue you can possibly obtain**...The battle for that, the struggle for that is happening right now, right here. **Forget everything else, in this one situation in which you could choose a lie or the truth is what stands between you and your goals.**
	This is the most effective tool that I have to become the person I want to be.
	**Everything is behaviour, everything is personality and once I conquer the present moment habit will take over.**

**Fighting is not everything all at once, present, past and future but it's only this one instant of it**
	**We only have a little will power, everything else is habit**. We **build new habit by applying that new small will power we have in the present moment**. 
	**.**
	**Just saying no** this one time, say **"I don't know the next time, I've said no, I've stood my ground and I acted exactly the way I wanted to act the kind of person that I want to be would have acted that's how I have acted"**.
The present moment, the intend to do something in the very moment to do something is the very act it self, stick to that and think of nothing else.
All of my dream need to be and can only be relized and to be relized or not relized right this instance.
