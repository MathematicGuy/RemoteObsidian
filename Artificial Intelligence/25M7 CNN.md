Note - goes into each topic with Intuition
*Intro to Image in Computer Vision*
*Introduct to Tensor (1D, 2D and 3D)*
*CNN Overview* 
	Describe CNN *architecture fully* and *each of its component along with their functionality and purpose*. Bonus: show Different before and After with [Real Example](https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/). 
	
*CNN Operation in Depth*
(For each Operation explain. What it do ? Why do we need it)
+ *What is Convolution ?* (Interative Convolution Operation) 
+ *Padding* (when padding is necessary ?)
+ *Stride* (stride of 1 == the kernel move 1 pixel per dot product)
	Effect of Stride to Feature Extraction. 
	Local feature vs Global feature 
+ *Explain ReLU function* 
	Purpose: Introduce Non-Linearity (*Explain Non-Linearity and why*) and remove Noise ???  
	[source](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-main-role-of-ReLU-Activation-Function-in-deep-learning): In Image Processing using CNNs, we _use ReLU activation_ to _remove_ an unnecessary _noise_ due to negative _values_ that could persists. For those ...
