**A lot of real world systems are nonlinear in nature, but given a certain operating point or region these systems can be approximated to be linear.** This can be done using the Taylor series, and this video shows you a step by step way to show if a system is linear or not and how you can linearize it: https://youtu.be/V1uvK4Ii_ks?si=P-XlMQ8nB08c0s_U



> **Linear Approximation** is the process of a**pproximating the curve by a straight line at a specific point.** The idea is that for **small changes in $x$ near $a$, the straight line will behave very similarly to the function $f(x)$.**
 
note: 2 function or values combine can be called an *expression*.
Mathematically, the **linear approximation** of a function $f(x)$ near $x=a$ is given by:
$$f(x) \approx f(a)+f'(a)(x−a)$$
1. $f(a):$ value of function f(a) at point a. Representing the height of the function at that point.
2. $f'(a):$ the derivative of $f$ at point $a$ represent a slope of the tangent line $a$ (độ dốc tại của đường tiếp tuyến tại a) which show how fast the function is changing at point a. 
3. $(x -a):$ This represent how far is $x$ to $a$. The expression $f'(a)(x -a)$ gives the change in value of $f(x)$ based on the slope at $x=a$. 
+ $ The whole expression say update $f(x)$ closer to $a$ by the derivative (i.e. how fast $f$ is changing at that point) at point $a$..
