	Mathematics -> General Machine Learning Knowledge -> Tensor Flow -> Deep Learning -> Computer Vision -> Project  


**Ultra Learning**
	Identify what to learn -> Resource Research -> Overview Resource (CRUCIAL for motivation & study efficiency) -> Turtorial/Courses -> Listen & Understanding First -> Documenting -> Pratice Coding using my Document -> Improving -> Repeat.
	
+ (Know what to learn/Best to learn) -> (Know what I learn) -> Remember what I learn -> Understand what I learn -> Apply What I Learn.  
	
+ **Understand** new topics **fast** by **understand topic's key words** -> **Understand explaination more efficiency**. Always look and identify key words meaning. (**Learning is not** solely about **explain sth** by your own term, **Learning is about understanding** the **others terms**. Why try to make thing up when they are already there?)
