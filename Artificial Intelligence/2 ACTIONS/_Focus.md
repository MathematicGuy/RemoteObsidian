#System
- [ ] [[Courses Pipeline]]
	Mathematics -> General Machine Learning Knowledge -> Tensor Flow -> Deep Learning -> Computer Vision -> Project  
**Study Pipeline**
+ Resource Research -> Turtorial/Courses -> Understanding -> Documenting -> Pratice Coding using my Document -> Improving -> Repeat
+ (Know what to learn/Bes t to learn) -> (Know what I learn) -> Remember what I learn -> Understand what I learn -> Apply What I Learn.
