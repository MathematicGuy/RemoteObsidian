**Core Skills**

- **Python Programming:** You'll need a solid grasp of Python to implement everything.
    - **Resources:**
        - "Learn Python the Hard Way" (book)
        - Codecademy's Python course: [https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3)
- **Computer Vision (OpenCV):** For facial image processing, feature extraction, etc.
    - **Resources:**
        - OpenCV Tutorials: [https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/)
        - PyImageSearch (excellent blog with practical guides): [https://www.pyimagesearch.com/](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)
- **Natural Language Processing (NLTK or Spacy):** For analyzing the descriptive text generated about student actions.
    - **Resources:**
        - NLTK Book: [https://www.nltk.org/book/](https://www.nltk.org/book/)
        - Spacy Documentation: [https://spacy.io/](https://spacy.io/)
- **Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras):** To build your emotion detection and classification models.
    - **Resources**
        - Scikit-learn: [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
        - TensorFlow: [https://www.tensorflow.org/](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
        - Keras: [https://keras.io/](https://keras.io/)

**Specialized Areas**

- **Facial Action Coding System (FACS):** Understanding FACS will help you in feature engineering and interpreting facial expressions.
    - **Resources:**
        - Paul Ekman Group website: [https://www.paulekman.com/](https://www.paulekman.com/)
- **Deep Learning for Facial Emotion Recognition:** Dive into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based emotion detection.
    - **Resources:**
        - Course: "Deep Learning for Computer Vision" on Coursera or similar platforms.
        - Research Papers: Search on Google Scholar for relevant papers
- **NLP for Sentiment Analysis:** Learn techniques for classifying sentiment and interest from the descriptions of students' actions.
    - **Resources:**
        - TextBlob (simple sentiment analysis): [https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/)
        - Courses on sentiment analysis on Coursera, Udemy, etc.

**Additional Considerations**

- **Data Collection and Annotation:** This project will likely involve creating your own dataset. Think about video collection, how you'll label facial expressions, and how to generate the descriptive text.
- **Data Visualization:** Choose a library for creating insightful visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh).
- **Project Structure and Management:** Learn tools like Git to manage your code effectively.
