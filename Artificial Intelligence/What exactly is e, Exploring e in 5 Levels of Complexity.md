### Level 2: Probability

But What's the probability the player loses all n times? The fomular is since $\frac{1}{n}$ represent winning and $1-\frac{1}{n}$ represent lossing, n times (to power of n)
$$\left( 1-\frac{1}{n} \right)^n$$

(note: simplified using calculus we got $\frac{1}{e}$)

### Level 3: Calculus
> We have seen e as a limit, we could also see e as an derivative.

to get e there just 1 more step

**(nah....I not going into this)**
a lot of simplification and convertion we got e:
