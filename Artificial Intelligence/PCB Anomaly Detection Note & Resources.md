### Prerequisite
+ PCB Board (2 versions for each Model: Defecs and Non-Defects PCB)
	PCB Board Models must match with the training Dataset Model
+ Training Dataset 
+ Need a Bright Light for Visual (Scanning) Enhanment
+ Understand [How to find defects on a PCB](https://www.proto-electronics.com/blog/how-to-find-defects-on-a-pcb)
+ [[Anomaly Detection in Machine Learning]]



### Algorithm
+ **[[Anomaly detection in ML]]** for Anomaly Detection ([example](https://youtu.be/Q7YGBwKVpds?si=9FEmW0fZ2KUY7-v4))
+ [[Anomaly Detection]]
+ [[PCB Anomaly Detection RoadMap]]

DRC Design errors
Defect Types:
+ Unique Detection for each PCB Models
+ Detect of solder bridge (thép hàn ở chân cpu bị hàn lỗi hoặc nối với nhau, etc...)
+ Scratch Detection
