In the real world, having two predicted bounding boxes in **`pred_boxes`** with the same **`train_idx`** (image index) and **`class_prediction`** equal to the same class (e.g., class 0) can happen due to several reasons related to how object detection models work. Here's an explanation of why this can occur:

---

### 1. **Overlapping Detections for the Same Object**
- **Why It Happens**: 
  Object detection models often use sliding windows or anchor boxes to predict objects. If multiple anchor boxes or proposals have high confidence scores for the same object, the model may generate multiple overlapping predictions for a single object.
- **Example**:
  - A person (Class 0) in an image might be detected by two overlapping anchor boxes at slightly different locations.
- **Real-World Scenario**: 
  - In crowded scenes, overlapping detections often occur when objects are partially occluded or close together.

---

### 2. **Insufficient Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**
- **Why It Happens**: 
  Non-Maximum Suppression is a post-processing step that removes overlapping predictions based on IoU and confidence scores. If NMS isn't aggressive enough (e.g., a high IoU threshold), multiple predictions for the same object may remain.
- **Example**:
  - A car (Class 0) is detected twice because NMS allows predictions with IoU = 0.5 to coexist.
- **Real-World Scenario**:
  - Models with poorly tuned NMS thresholds may output redundant predictions, especially when confidence scores are similar.

---

### 3. **Multiple Predictions for a Single Object Across Model Outputs**
- **Why It Happens**: 
  Object detection models output multiple predictions per class during inference. Sometimes, these predictions for the same object remain after filtering if their confidence scores are above the threshold.
- **Example**:
  - Two bounding boxes for the same dog (Class 0) have confidence scores of 0.9 and 0.8, and both pass the confidence threshold.
- **Real-World Scenario**:
  - Objects with irregular shapes or poses may result in multiple valid detections from the model.

---

### 4. **Close Objects of the Same Class**
- **Why It Happens**: 
  Two actual objects of the same class are very close to each other. The model detects both objects, but due to slight inaccuracies in localization, the bounding boxes overlap heavily, making it appear as if one object has been detected twice.
- **Example**:
  - Two apples (Class 0) on a table are detected with bounding boxes that overlap due to localization error.
- **Real-World Scenario**:
  - In scenes with crowded objects (e.g., a fruit basket or a crowd of people), the model might struggle to differentiate between individual objects.

---

### 5. **Ambiguity in the Dataset**
- **Why It Happens**: 
  If the dataset used to train the model has inconsistent or ambiguous annotations (e.g., two bounding boxes for the same object in the ground truth), the model might learn to predict multiple overlapping boxes for a single object.
- **Example**:
  - A chair (Class 0) is annotated with two overlapping boxes in the training data.
- **Real-World Scenario**:
  - Poorly labeled datasets, especially crowdsourced ones, often introduce these kinds of errors.

---

### 6. **Object Shadows or Reflections**
- **Why It Happens**: 
  Shadows, reflections, or transparent surfaces can confuse the model into thinking there are multiple objects where only one exists.
- **Example**:
  - A dog (Class 0) standing next to a glass door might result in one prediction for the dog and another for its reflection.
- **Real-World Scenario**:
  - Common in outdoor images with reflective surfaces (e.g., glass, water).

---

### 7. **Multi-Scale Predictions**
- **Why It Happens**: 
  Many models (e.g., YOLO, SSD) predict objects at multiple scales. If two scales generate predictions for the same object, both may end up in the output if not handled correctly.
- **Example**:
  - A large car (Class 0) is detected both at a coarse scale and a fine scale.
- **Real-World Scenario**:
  - Large objects in the image can trigger predictions at multiple scales.

---

### Summary of Why It Happens in the Real World
- **Overlapping proposals from anchor boxes.**
- **Poor or insufficient Non-Maximum Suppression.**
- **Ambiguities or inconsistencies in training data.**
- **Close proximity of objects of the same class.**
- **Reflections, shadows, or partial occlusion.**
- **Multi-scale predictions.**

### How It's Handled in MAP Calculation
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: The algorithm calculates IoU to determine whether a predicted box corresponds to a ground truth box.
- **`amount_bboxes`**: Tracks which ground truth boxes have already been matched to ensure each GT box is matched at most once, avoiding double-counting true positives.
- **Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**: Removes redundant overlapping boxes at inference time to reduce this issue before evaluation. 

By addressing these challenges, models can perform better in both detection and evaluation.

### Summary of Predictions

| Prediction Index | Image | Class | IoU    | TP/FP | Ground Truth Status     |
|-------------------|-------|-------|--------|-------|--------------------------|
| 0                 | 0     | 0     | 0.90   | TP    | GT 1 matched.            |
| 1                 | 0     | 0     | 0.85   | FP    | Duplicate for GT 1.      |
| 2                 | 0     | 1     | No IoU | FP    | No matching GT.          |

This example demonstrates how `amount_bboxes` ensures that each ground truth is matched at most once and helps differentiate between TPs and FPs effectively.
