+  arrow above parameter (e.g. x) notate that it a vector of number array. 
+ Each column represet a feature
+ Each row represent a example of its column. For example $x^{(1)} _{i}$ mean feature 1 (i.e. column 1) feature index at i (i.e. thá»© i or i-th) 

Model:

Example for house price prediction base on features the house have, we can plot the function as (base price as the starting price):

#### Vectorization
> Achieve parallel mutiplication in matrix multiplication for efficiency (which processed using GPU)  

>`np.dot()`: help you to calc the sum of the product between 2 corresponding elements.

+ ? If 2 matrix use np.dot() each value in matrix 1 row will multiply with each value in matrix 2 column.

> Vectorization allow parallel processing (i.e. the computer subtract/addition/divided/multiply at the same time)
