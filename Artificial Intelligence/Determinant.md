> Determinant are the **Area of the Matrix**
+ Calculate by subtracting all diagnol values to eachothers from both left and right. 
+ Example from the image below show that: 0 * 1 - (-1.5 * 2) = 3  
	_This fomula start from applying pythagorean. click here to [[understand pythagorian in matrix]]

+ But if the Determinant is 0 the Matrix volumn would be 0, thus represent a line in Space.

+ ? But what if the Determinant is Negative. Well, determinant are made by vector coordination, if it result in like -2 it just the matrix pointed at a invert direction with the volumn of 2.

+ ! Singular Matrix can't be use to calc Determinant becase they are either have *Infinitely Solutions* (Coincident Vectors) which represent a line or have *No Solution* (Parallel Vectors) which represent literally 2 lines. 
	In either cases, it impossible to calculate volume of the matrix.
