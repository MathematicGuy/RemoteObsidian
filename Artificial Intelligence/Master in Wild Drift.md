**Current Rank:** Platinum II
**Aimed Rank:** Master 

Each Rank have **4 Divisions**. 
+ **Plat** require **4 Marks** to Advance. (8 more marks to advance)
+ **Emerald** require **5 Marks** to Advance (20 marks)
+ **Diamond** require **6 Marks** to Advance (24 marks)
+ **Master** mean Congratulation.
Meaning if everything happend perfectly I need to win total of 52 win/marks. 1 match is about 15 to 23 mins or 22 mins on average to complete so 52 wins would consume 1144 mins or 19 hrs. 

To be realistic **my win rate is 60% so 84 match is required to reach 52 wins**. Then **84 match would be 2016 mins or 33.6 hrs** or "1 days 10 hrs and 50 mins". With additional time for finding match is 2 mins on average, the total time will be 2016 mins or 33.6 hrs.   

Say worst outcome would be 100 to 52 wins ratio, 2400 mins or 40 hrs max.   
From 3/3 to 30/3 is 57 days, 8 weeks, or 1368 hrs. Thus reaching master take up 2.456% - 2.923% of my time, so reaching Master is achievable. 

To reach 52 wins, I need to play 11-13 matches per week, 12 on average. That 288 mins or 4.8 hrs of LoL per Weeks. Say each week I play 5 matches weekdays (90 mins / 1.5 hrs) and 7 matches weekends (160 mins / 2.6 hrs), would fit "reaching master" plan nicely. Or **2 matches each days on weekday** (i.e. 10 matches) and 2-3 matches weekend** (i.e. 2 matches).

**KPI:** *6 wins per week* (kinda hard actually)

**Routine 1:**
	**Weekday:** Morning from 6 AM, Night from 7 - 8 PM. (10 matches)
	**Weekend:** Morning, Afternoon, Evening. Restricted at night. (2 matches)

**Routine 2:**
	**Weekday:** Only 1 match in the Morning -> 5 matches.
	**Weekend:** 7 matches.  

**Routine 3: Flexible**
