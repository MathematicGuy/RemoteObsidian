Resnet inspired upon a Euler Fomula to learn continuous data but the method itself update in discrete-time like a camera snap-shot, not continous. And the Euler Fomula prove to be unstable, a quick and dirty method to say.

A better architecture is ODE improve upon ResNets idea but update coninuously. Neural ODEs model learn the dynamic bahaviour of the data while filter out the noise.

**Neural ODEs** - clean the data which used to feed into other model.

+ $ This beg the question. *What if AI could learn the timeless laws that govern our world.*
