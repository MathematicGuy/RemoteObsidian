Install with **pip vs conda**
```ad-info
**pip:**
- **If you're working strictly in a Python environment and don't need packages beyond what's primarily found on PyPI**.
- When you need the absolute latest bleeding-edge version of a Python package.

**Conda**
- **When managing projects that have dependencies on packages beyond standard Python libraries.**
- When you need to manage environments with different versions of Python or non-Python packages.
- When faster installation through pre-compiled binaries is a priority.
