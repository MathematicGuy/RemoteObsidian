For Short:
	**Neural Networks Can't learn Perfectly. But its can learn Approximate to the True Result.**

## [[Where Neural Networks come from]]
From **Function of Approximation**
	Its take Input and Output. Numbers in Numbers out 
![[Pasted image 20230620111554.png]]
Ex: Input an X -> You get an Y.

### Neuron
![[Pasted image 20230620133813.png]]
Just like a Function, take any Numbers of Input -> 1 Output
Constructed on ==Weight (w) & Bias (x)  
Values that can change when the individual Learned.==

Neuron are Building block of Neural Networks.

**Add more Neurons** -> **More Improvement** -> **Universal Function Approximator (Approximate to any degree)**


## Problem
+ To Approximate Data you'll need Enough Information for its. Else it all Wrong ![[Pasted image 20230620134834.png]]![[Pasted image 20230620134852.png]]
