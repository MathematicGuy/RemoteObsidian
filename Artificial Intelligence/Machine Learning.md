[ Machine Learning is ==turning things Ì£(data)== into numbers and  ===finding patterns === in those numbers ]

=> Allow machine to learn without explicitly programmed.

**Machine Learning require Traditional Programming** 
+ 1.0 -> Do as its told. to finish A. 
+ 2.0 -> Given a pattern to learn to finish A.
[[Software 1.0]]                       [[Software 2.0]]                       [[AI Quizz]]

-> Turn input into number. Let the Machine Learning figure out the pattern in those number.

### [[Why Machine Learning]]

# < What to cover - broadly >

## -- Problem --
### 1) [[Machine Learning Problems]]
	 What is it look like?   
+ #### [[MLP Catagories]]
	+ ##### [[Supervised Learning]]
	+ ##### [[Unsupervised Learning]]

	+ ##### [[Transfer Learning]]

+ #### [[Classification]]
 
+ #### [[Regression]]
 
+ #### [[Sequence to sequence (seq2seq)]]
 
+ #### [[Clustering]]

+ #### [[Dimensionality Reduction]]

### 2) [[Machine Learning Process]]
	 Once you've found the problem, what the steps might you           take to solve it?

## -- Tools --
### 3) [[Machine Learning Tools]]
	 What should you use to build your solution?
+ ### Machine Learning Tools (tools you can use to get the job done)
+ 
+ ### Machine Learning Mathematics (whats running under the hood when you write machine learning code)

### 4) [[Machine Learning Mathematics]]
	 What exactly is happening under the hood? (MUST KNOW)
