5. **Directionality and Representation**:
- To represent this change on the unit circle, we need to show the direction of the change.
	
- When $Δ(cos⁡x)$ is negative, it means the x-coordinate (cosine value) has decreased.
	
- To visually and mathematically represent this decrease, we use the term $-\Delta(\cos x)$.
