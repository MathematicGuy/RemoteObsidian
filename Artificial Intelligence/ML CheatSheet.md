**Case Study**: Given a table of student addmitted to medical school with N as the number students (i.e. a sample), P as the number of Feature (i.e. GPA and MCAT) of each student sample. 
+ ? Taken out 4 training set with n samples and P features each. $M_{k}$ where $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ as each training set Model.

+ ? **What does it mean for a model to be overly complex ?** 
+ $ It mean for the training set you train the mode, it gonna learn the training set too well. Although **there're some crucial pattern** which determint if student will or will not get in. But **there're also noises in these training set**, that mean there **patterns we could find in the training set but they aren't generalize to the general population** of student who are applying to medical school. So an overly **complex model** will **pick up those patterns that don't actually exist, it'll learn and think it important.** 
> Basically, **while they learn the correct patterns, they'll also learn the noises**, which the model sometime think it important and make wrong prediction.
