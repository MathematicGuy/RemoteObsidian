### 1. **Log of a Product**:
   $log_b(x \cdot y) = \log_b(x) + \log_b(y)$
   - The logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms.
   - This is useful when simplifying expressions involving the product of two numbers.

### 2. **Log of a Quotient**:
   $\log_b\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) = \log_b(x) - \log_b(y)$
   - The logarithm of a quotient is the difference between the logarithms of the numerator and the denominator.

### 3. **Log of a Power**:
   $\log_b(x^n) = n \cdot \log_b(x)$
   - The logarithm of a number raised to a power is the power times the logarithm of the number.

### 4. **Change of Base Formula**:
   $\log_b(x) = \frac{\log_k(x)}{\log_k(b)}$
   - This allows you to change the base of the logarithm from b to another base k. A common case is converting to natural logarithm (ln(x) or log_e(x)).

### 5. **Log of 1**:
   $\log_b(1) = 0$
   - The logarithm of 1 to any base is always 0, because $b^0 = 1$.

### 6. **Log of the Base**:
   $\log_b(b) = 1$
   - The logarithm of the base itself is always 1, because $b^1 = b$.

### 7. **Inverse of Exponential and Logarithmic Functions**:
   $b^{\log_b(x)} = x \quad \text{and} \quad \log_b(b^x) = x$
   - Exponential and logarithmic functions are inverses of each other.

### 8. **Natural Logarithm (ln)**:
   $\log_e(x) = \ln(x)$
   - When the base is Eulerâ€™s number e (approximately 2.718), the logarithm is called the **natural logarithm** and is often written as ln(x).

### 9. **Logarithmic Identity for Reciprocal**:
   $\log_b\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = -\log_b(x)$
   - The logarithm of the reciprocal of a number is the negative of the logarithm of the number.

### 10. **Base Change Identity with Exponent**:
   $b^{x} = e^{x \cdot \ln(b)}$
   - This property is useful for converting expressions involving powers of numbers into exponentials with base e.

### 11. **Logarithm of a Root**:
   $\log_b\left(\sqrt[n]{x}\right) = \frac{1}{n} \cdot \log_b(x)$
   - The logarithm of a root can be rewritten as a fraction where the denominator is the root index.
