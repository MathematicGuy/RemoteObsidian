### Baysian Optimization 
Using statistic to find the best parameter

### Stochastic Gradient Descent

**Stochastic (adj):** randomly determined; **A variable or process is stochastic if there is uncertainty or randomness involved in the outcomes.** 

Many machine learning algorithms are stochastic because they explicitly use randomness during optimization or learning.

Note this on Friday: [SGD and Adam](https://machinelearningcoban.com/2017/01/16/gradientdescent2/)

**SGD with Momentum**

>The larger the momentum, the more normal update influent by the previous update.

# Adam: Combining Adaptive Learning Rates and Momentum
> Moving faster when moving in the same direction, slowing down when moving in the right direction.
