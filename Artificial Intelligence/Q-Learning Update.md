### Understanding the Update Term

The term you're referring to:

$\alpha \left[r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\right]$

is the amount by which the Q-value $Q(s, a)$ is adjusted during each update in Q-Learning. Let's break it down:

1. **$r$**: The immediate reward received after taking action $a$ in state $s$.
2. **$\gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$**: The discounted maximum expected future reward obtainable from the next state $s'$.
3. **$Q(s, a)$**: The current estimate of the Q-value for the state-action pair $(s, a)$.

### Positive or Negative Updates

- **Positive Update**: If the target value $r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ is greater than the current estimate $Q(s, a)$, the Q-value will increase, reflecting an optimistic update.
- **Negative Update**: If the target value is less than the current estimate, the Q-value will decrease, reflecting a pessimistic update.

### Early Iterations

- **Early in Training**: The Q-values $Q(s, a)$ are typically initialized randomly or to zero. Since the agent has little knowledge, the estimates $Q(s, a)$ are not yet accurate.
    - **Large TD Error**: The term $\gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ might be relatively large, leading to a large temporal difference (TD) error $r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)$.
    - **Impact**: This results in a large update step, driving the Q-value toward a more accurate estimate, potentially leading to faster convergence in the early stages.

### Later Iterations

- **As Training Progresses**: The Q-values start to approximate the true values more closely.
    - **Smaller TD Error**: The difference $r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)$ decreases as the agent's estimates improve.
    - **Smaller Updates**: The updates become smaller, fine-tuning the Q-values and gradually moving them toward their true values.

### Visualization of the Components Over Iterations

To visualize this, let's consider the effect of each component at different stages in training (e.g., iterations 5, 30, 50):

1. **Iteration 5 (Early Stage):**
    
    - **Scenario**: Q-values are still very rough estimates.
    - **$r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$** might be significantly larger than $Q(s, a)$, leading to a large positive update.
    - **Update**: The Q-value increases significantly to correct the initial estimate.
    
    $\Delta Q(s,a) \approx \alpha \times \text{Large Positive Value}$
    
2. **Iteration 30 (Mid Training):**
    
    - **Scenario**: The agent has gained some understanding, and Q-values are closer to their true values.
    - **$r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$** is now closer to $Q(s, a)$, resulting in a smaller positive or negative update, depending on the scenario.
    - **Update**: The Q-value adjusts by a moderate amount.
    
    $\Delta Q(s,a) \approx \alpha \times \text{Moderate Positive/Negative Value}$
    
3. **Iteration 50 (Late Training):**
    
    - **Scenario**: Q-values are nearing convergence, closely approximating their true values.
    - **$r + \gamma \cdot \max_{a'} Q(s', a')$** is very close to $Q(s, a)$, leading to a very small update.
    - **Update**: The Q-value adjusts slightly, making fine-tuned adjustments.
    
    $\Delta Q(s,a) \approx \alpha \times \text{Small Positive/Negative Value}$
    

### Summary

- **Early Iterations:** The agent makes large adjustments to the Q-values because the difference between the estimated and target Q-values is large.
- **Mid Training:** Adjustments become smaller as the agent's estimates improve, but there is still room for moderate changes.
- **Late Training:** Adjustments are minimal as the Q-values are close to convergence.

The update magnitude decreases over time, ensuring that the agent's learning process starts with exploration and broad corrections and gradually shifts to exploitation and fine-tuning. This dynamic behavior helps the agent learn effectively across different stages of training.
