### Beginner
- **Image Processing**:
    - **Basic Image Operations**: Use image reading, resizing, and color space conversion to preprocess ID card images.
		
	- **Thresholding**: Apply thresholding techniques to highlight text on the ID card, making it easier for OCR to recognize characters.
		
    - **Morphological Operations**: Use dilation and erosion to enhance the visibility of text by removing noise or closing gaps between characters.

### Advanced Level
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**:
    - Use Tesseract OCR or a deep learning-based OCR model to convert the text in the ID card image to machine-readable text.
	    
	- Preprocessing for OCR (denoising, binarization) will improve text extraction accuracy.
	
- **Image Segmentation** (optional but useful):
    - Use segmentation to isolate regions of interest on the ID card, such as the name, ID number, and date of birth, before applying OCR.
