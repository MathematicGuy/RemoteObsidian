The difference between the vectors 1,3 and 4,1 is also taken component-wise to be 3-2. That is, this vector over here, which doesn't look like anything special, except if you were to translate it, it matches precisely with the vector obtained by joining the points 1,3 and 4,1.

+ ? **Key Points:**
	- **Scalars**: The dot product outputs a single scalar value, not a new vector.
	- **Dimensionality:** The two vectors in a dot product calculation must have the same dimensions.
