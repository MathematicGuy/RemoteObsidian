# Module 1: Getting Started
+ ! `[0, 255] <-> [Black, White]`
**Import Library and Display image by NxN pixel**
![[Pasted image 20241205101143.png]]


**Display Images using Matplotlib**
Color Map by Default
![[Pasted image 20241205101240.png]]
Colormap = 'gray'
![[Pasted image 20241205101317.png]]
Read Image as Gray Scale, quite cool huh
![[Pasted image 20241205101356.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241205101415.png]]

Opencv use BGR. So RGB image get mapped to BGR
![[Pasted image 20241205101653.png]]
>Keep in mind that OpenCV store image in BGR.
![[Pasted image 20241205101724.png]]

**Extract Specific color from a Image**
![[Pasted image 20241205102101.png]]

### Converting to different Color Spaces
![[Pasted image 20241205102144.png]]
Ex: RGB to RGB, or RBG to GRAYSCALE
![[Pasted image 20241205102218.png]]
Ex2: Change to HSV (Hue, Staturation, Value) color space
+ *Hue:* Original/Pure Color, *Staturation:* color intensity, *Value:* lightness or darkness of a color. By Adjust S and V we can create many more color.

# Module 4: Image Enhancement 
### Adjust Brightness
Method: Create a matrix the same size as the image, multiply it with a factor and add matrix value to the image.   
![[Pasted image 20241205093047.png]]

### Multiplication or Constract
+ @ Contrast is the difference in the intensity value of the pixels of an image.
**Method:** Just like adding a matrix can change the brightness of the image. Multiplying matrix with image's pixels value can improve the constract of the image.
+ ? **Problems:** when mulitiplying, some pixels value exceed 255 and restart itself  to 1 (+ matrix value) 
![[Pasted image 20241205093322.png]]

**Handling Overflow using `np.clip`**
>Clip value in the range between `[0, 255]`
![[Pasted image 20241205094230.png]]

### Image Thresholding
> Image's pixels value > threshold become 1 else 0. Basically Binarified the whole image by a threshold.
>![[Pasted image 20241205094523.png]]![[Pasted image 20241205094538.png]]
>Example: ![[Pasted image 20241205094617.png]]
>**More Discrete Example**: Highlight Music Sheet  by threshold:
>+ **50 Problem:** Too Low, can't even catch black music note in bright light  
![[Pasted image 20241205094726.png]]

**Step 4: Apply background on the Mask:** Combine background image with cocacola image on *img_mask* area (i.e. white pixels areas)  
![[Pasted image 20241205100114.png]]

**Isolate foreground from Image**

# Module 7: Image Filtering and Edge Detection

```python
feature_params = dict(maxCorners = 500, qualityLevel = 0.2, minDistance = 15, blockSize = 9)
```
1. `maxCorners = 500`
+ Specifies the maximum number of corners to return.
+ If more than 500 corners are found, only the 500 strongest ones will be retained.

2. `qualityLevel = 0.2`
+ Represents the minimal accepted quality of image corners.
+ A cornerâ€™s quality is calculated relative to the best corner, which is assigned a value of 1.0. Relativ to the best corner mean: 
	$Threshold = \text{qualityLevel} \times  \text{Best coner value}$
	Only satify corners retain: $$R \geq \text{qualityLevel} \times R_{max}$$+ A `qualityLevel` of `0.2` means that corners below 20% of the maximum corner quality will be rejected.

3. `minDistance = 15`
- The minimum Euclidean distance (in pixels) between detected corners.
- This helps avoid detecting corners that are too close to each other.

4. **`blockSize = 9`**
- The size of the neighborhood (in pixels) used for corner detection.
- A larger block size smooths the image more and results in fewer but more robust corners.

# Module 8: Image Features and Image Alignment 

**Morphing Image**: by detection 4 corners point then morp 
![[Pasted image 20241205141826.png]]

### Step 1: Read Template and Scanned Iamge
![[Pasted image 20241205142003.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241205142035.png]]
**Original and Scanned**
>We compare the Scanned form with the Original to check if it morph the right way.
![[Pasted image 20241205142048.png]]

### Step 2: Find keypoints in both Images
![[Pasted image 20241205142125.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241205144612.png]]
Keypoint: red-circle
+ Circle-center represent key-point location 
+ Circle-size represent key-point size
+ The radius line (i.e. line connect the center to the outside of the circle) represent key-point orientation.


### Step 3: Match keypoints in the 2 Image
![[Pasted image 20241205144640.png]]
>Matching Key Point -> Get Corresponding Keypoints
![[Pasted image 20241205144811.png]]

### Step 4: Find Homography
> Compute the homography from the set of corresponding keypoints.

# Module 9: Creating Panoramas using OpenCV (Skip for now)

# Module 10: High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging
(re-note, current note not so detail)

### Basic Idea
1. The dynamic range of images is limited to 8-bits (0 -255) per channel.
2. Very bright pixels saturate to 255
3. Very dark pixels clip to 0
### Step 1: Capture Multiple Exposures
![[Pasted image 20241205150008.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241205150043.png]]

### Step 2: Align Images
Left/Right: no HDR / with HDR (look more correct)
![[Pasted image 20241205150150.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241205150237.png]]
MTB - Median Threshold Bitmask

### Step 3: Estimate Camera Response Function
After image alignment, we need to calc camera response function
![[Pasted image 20241205150401.png]]

### Step 4: Merge Exposure into an HDR Iamge
>Note: Merging process intentionally ignore pixels values close to 0 or 255. Bc pixel values close to those extreme bring no useful information. 
![[Pasted image 20241205151638.png]]

Because ther multiple images of the scene at different exposure settings the hope is that for every pixels we have at least 1 image that contain an intensity that is neither too dark nor too bright. 

However there're 1 problem still remain which is the intensity values are no longer in the 0-255 range. Of course black can be 0, but HDR image can record light intensities from 0 to essentially infinite 
-> Need a process to bring the image intensity back down to the 0-255 range (Tonemapping)

### Step 5: Tonemapping
>Many Tonemapping algorithms are available in OpenCV. We chose Durand as it has more controls.
+ ? Mapping HDR images to 8-bits to channel images
![[Pasted image 20241205152404.png]]
Help expose to all region of the scene
![[Pasted image 20241205152445.png]]
Method 2: Tonemap using Reinhard's method
![[Pasted image 20241205152508.png]]
![[Pasted image 20241205152458.png]]
Method 3: Mantiuk's method, almost the combination of the 2 methods above.

# Module 11: Object Tracking (Important)

**Tracking:** refer to estimating the location of object and predicting its future position based on its current state and motion patterns.

**Flow:** Detect Object -> Predict object position using an  motion model (like Kalman filter or optical flow) -> fine-tune the location of the object.

### Tracker Class in OpenCV
1. BOOSTING
2. MIL
3. KCF
4. CRST
5. TLD
	Tends to recover from occulusions
6. MEDIANFLOW
	 Good for predictable slow motion
7. GOTURN
	 Deep Learning based
	 Most Accurate
8. MOSSE
	 Fastest

**Define Bounding Box and Text Annotation**
![[Pasted image 20241205155130.png]]

### Choose & Download Tracker Type 
>GOTURN for example
```python
if not os.path.isfile('goturn.prototxt') or not os.path.isfile('goturn.caffemodel'):
    print("Downloading GOTURN model zip file")
    urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://www.dropbox.com/sh/77frbrkmf9ojfm6/AACgY7-wSfj-LIyYcOgUSZ0Ua?dl=1', 'GOTURN.zip')
    
    # Uncompress the file
    !tar -xvf GOTURN.zip

    # Delete the zip file
    os.remove('GOTURN.zip')
```
