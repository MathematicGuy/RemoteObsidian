+ ! Note to myself: Hỏi lại sau mỗi phần nói, tương tác với người nghe nhiều hơn. Nhiệm vụ là **giải thích càng trực quan, dễ hiểu càng tốt vì người nghe không thể hỏi nếu họ không hiểu** hoặc ko có kiến thức tiền đề tr'c. 


Meeting Note: 
	**Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)** -> generate new data. 

Đọc survey -> ưu tiên Survey trong càng mới càng tốt, nhưng không quá 5 năm gần nhất. 


Gradient Descent giúp tìm điểm nhỏ nhất/lớn nhất bằng cách tính đạo hàm để đi ngược lại hướng đạo hàm đó. 

U-Net: 1 bên trích xuất đặc trưng, 1 bên lấy cái đặc trưng đó đi tô màu.

# Research on Artificial-Intelligence-Assisted Medicine: A Survey on Medical Artificial Intelligent
### Summary of Key Points:

#### **1. Introduction**

- **Rationale for AI in Healthcare**:
    
    - The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) is addressing critical healthcare challenges, including shortages of resources, uneven regional distribution, and rising demands for precision medicine.
    - AI's capabilities in machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning enable improved diagnosis, efficiency in healthcare delivery, and personalized patient care.
- **Applications in Disease Prevention and Management**:
    
    - AI facilitates early identification of epidemics and genetic sequencing for conditions like SARS and COVID-19, overcoming traditional manual methods' limitations.
    - In pharmaceuticals, AI accelerates drug discovery, reduces costs, and enables precision medication through big data analysis.
    - Enhanced diagnostic and surgical accuracy is achieved through AI's use of medical imaging, lesion identification, and adaptive radiotherapy.
- **Post-Diagnosis and Health Management**:
    
    - AI supports proactive healthcare by emphasizing prevention, health management plans, and personalized interventions for diet, exercise, and mental health.
    - Robotic applications in surgery, rehabilitation, and service improve care quality and efficiency while addressing the demand for medical resources.

#### **2. AI in Healthcare Informatics**

- **Classification of AI Techniques**:
    
    - Supervised learning (e.g., decision trees, support vector machines), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering), reinforcement learning, and deep learning are foundational methods.
    - Frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch enable efficient training, modeling, and application of AI algorithms in healthcare settings.
- **Applications in Medical Informatics**:
    
    - AI excels in genomics for disease prediction and survival analysis, utilizing deep learning and multi-omics data to enhance precision in medical research.
    - Drug discovery benefits significantly from AI, with virtual screening and drug repurposing reducing costs and timelines.
    - Electronic medical records are better managed and mined with AI, improving data extraction and insights.
    - Robotics powered by AI deliver high-precision tasks in surgery, rehabilitation, and diagnostics, contributing to better patient outcomes.
