[AI Field Skill Tree](https://www.omelet.tech/ai-field-engineering-skill-tree/)

applied research - find solutions to practical problems. focus on immediate commercial outcomes


research focus on long term outcomes...find the answers for fundamental questions and expand body of theoretical knowledge


Research scientist - develop original ideas - might require PhD 
Research engineer - Use engineer to actualize ideas - doesn’t require PhDs 
Scientists and engineers are the equal authors of the paper


Data scientist - Extract knowledge and insights from structures and unstructured data, use data to help the company make decisions. Is a scientist and engineering isn’t a top priority.


ML Engineer = ML model learn from data, develop model to turn data into products
MLE at starts might spend most of their time wrangling data and understanding data and setting up infrastructures and deploying models instead of training ML models


Big companies can hire specialists - standardize the process 
Startups hire generalists - Focus change fast = process more flexible 


**Six common paths**
1. BS/MS in ML = ML engineers
2. Phd in ML => ML researcher
	Published at top tier 
3. Data Scientist -> on job training => ML engineer/researcher
4. Software engineer -> courses -> ML engineer
5. Adjacent fields ->On job training -> ML researcher
	example stats, physics, math
6. Unrelated fields -> residency/fellowship -> ML researcher Google, Facebook. MSFT, NVIDIA


Senior Role - Hired for skills
Junior Role - Hired for attitude - willing to learn


**PhD is required only for research scientists...lot more LME roles**
1. Companies hate hiring – boring for interviews
	
2. Companies don’t want the best people – they want the best people who can do a reasonable job within the time and monetary constraints
	
3. Company don’t know what they are hiring for – job description for reference purpose only
	
4. Most recruiters can’t evaluate technical skills – they rely on weak signals – previous employed, degree, GitHub, Kaggle, referrals, awards papers
	But not everyone can do Open sources and Kaggle since they might be able to afford free time
	
5. most interviewers are bad – little or no training 
	
6. Interview outcome depends on many random variables – bad sleep, mood. So many companies might reach outa year later.



**Steps in the interview process:**
Resume screen
Phone screen
Coding challenge/take-home assignments
Technical offsite interviews (1-2)
Onsite Interview (4-8) – sometimes give the schedule of what kind of question will be asked – behavioral, ML research, etc


**Bad questions:** 
Write down the equation for the adam optimizer
Question that test evaluate irrelevant skills – write a linked list 
Explain PCA to your grandma
Moore Penrose inverse or Frobenius norm (hard to remember names)
Open-ended question with one expected answer



**Good questions** 
test for understanding 
how K-means clustering work? if apply to this prob, that probs what is it advantages/disadvantage? why? 
explain how you develop the system
more of intuition
How a Named entity recognition on the test corpus A?


**Alternative interview formats:**
Multiple choice quiz
Quiz
Code debugging for example something that doesn’t converge ()
Pair Programming (debug or develop system with a interviewer while another interviewer take note) 
Good cop bad cop (Apple and Element AI…2 interviewers)


**Tips:**
Build up your portfolio and publish them 
	Contribute & Explain problems on a OpenSource project can leave good  Impression for interviewer 
Get people to refer you - x11 chance of getting a job
Don’t pretend that you know something when you don’t (bad ethics, 2 edge sword)
Don’t criticize your previous or current employers (prove for lack of responsibility or problem solving skills)
Don’t take about your age, marital status, religion, political affiliation (not irrelevant)
