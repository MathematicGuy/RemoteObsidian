**Project Prompts**

I’ve updated the dataset from "UCF-Crime and Real Life Violence Situations Dataset" to "HBD21" (assuming HBD21 is a dataset relevant to human behavior detection, possibly tailored for your project). I’ve also reviewed the logical flow of the prompts to ensure they align with your project plan, remain beginner-friendly, and form a cohesive progression from setup to deployment. Below, I’ll first explain the logical check, then provide the finalized prompts with the dataset change incorporated.

### Logical Check of the Prompts

1. **Prompt 1 (Overview)**:
   - **Logic**: Introduces the project, datasets, and goals (FPS, accuracy). Connects phases logically (skeleton data → features → classification).
   - **Check**: Clear and foundational. No dependency on specific datasets beyond mentioning them, so the switch to HBD21 fits seamlessly.

2. **Prompt 2 (Setup)**:
   - **Logic**: Guides dataset acquisition and tool installation (MediaPipe/OpenCV). Includes a demo for skeleton extraction.
   - **Check**: Dataset-specific instructions need updating (HBD21 instead of UCF-Crime). MediaPipe/OpenCV conflict resolution remains relevant. Logical progression from understanding to hands-on setup.

3. **Prompt 3 (Skeleton Extraction)**:
   - **Logic**: Implements skeleton data extraction with optimization for FPS, building on Prompt 2’s tools.
   - **Check**: Independent of dataset specifics, focuses on video processing. Logically follows setup and prepares for YOLO integration.

4. **Prompt 4 (YOLOv11 Training)**:
   - **Logic**: Trains YOLOv11 for person detection using HBD21, setting up bounding boxes for error correction.
   - **Check**: Dataset change (HBD21) requires slight tweak in wording. Logical bridge between skeleton data and error correction.

5. **Prompt 5 (Error Correction)**:
   - **Logic**: Combines MediaPipe skeletons with YOLOv11 bounding boxes, improving accuracy as per your algorithms.
   - **Check**: Dataset-agnostic, relies on prior outputs (skeletons, boxes). Logically advances accuracy goal.

6. **Prompt 6 (Feature Extraction)**:
   - **Logic**: Extracts features (joint locations, distances, angles) from corrected skeletons for DNN input.
   - **Check**: Builds directly on Prompt 5’s output. Dataset-independent, focuses on feature math. Logical prep for classification.

7. **Prompt 7 (DNN Training)**:
   - **Logic**: Designs and trains a DNN on extracted features, targeting 75-80% accuracy.
   - **Check**: Uses Prompt 6’s output. Logical step toward behavior classification. No dataset specifics needed.

8. **Prompt 8 (Testing)**:
   - **Logic**: Evaluates the system (FPS, accuracy) using a test set, suggesting improvements.
   - **Check**: Follows DNN training, tests full pipeline. Dataset mentioned only for context (HBD21 test split). Logical evaluation phase.

9. **Prompt 9 (Integration)**:
   - **Logic**: Combines all components into a working system, adds deployment ideas.
   - **Check**: Culminates prior steps into an end-to-end demo. Dataset-agnostic, focuses on integration. Logical finale.

10. **Prompt 10 (Planning)**:
    - **Logic**: Resolves challenges, fills timeline, and plans a demo, tying everything together.
    - **Check**: Wraps up by addressing your questions and scheduling. Dataset change doesn’t affect this. Logical conclusion.

**Overall Flow**: The prompts progress naturally: understanding → setup → implementation (skeleton, YOLO, error correction, features, DNN) → testing → integration → planning. The HBD21 change only affects Prompts 2 and 4 explicitly, with minor context updates elsewhere. No logical gaps detected.

### Finalized Prompts with HBD21 Dataset

#### Prompt 1: Understanding the Project Overview and Goals

**Prompt:**

"I’m a second-year computer science student working on a computer vision project titled 'Violent Behavior Detection in the School Environment.' My project plan includes three main phases: Skeleton Data Collection and Preprocessing, Feature Extraction, and Behavior Classification. I aim to use the HBD21 dataset, achieve >15 FPS and 75-80% accuracy, and leverage tools like OpenPose/MediaPipe and YOLOv11. Here’s the full system architecture from my document: [insert System Architecture section from PAGE1]. Can you explain this architecture, clarify how each phase connects, and suggest how I can align my goals (FPS, accuracy) with these phases?

### Notes
- **HBD21 Assumption**: I assume HBD21 is a video-based dataset with labeled human behaviors (e.g., violent vs. non-violent). If it differs significantly (e.g., only images), let me know, and I’ll adjust the prompts.
- **Placeholders**: Replace [insert section] with the exact text from your document when using these prompts.
- **Logical Integrity**: The sequence remains intact with HBD21, progressing from setup to evaluation, with each prompt building on the previous one’s output.

These prompts are now ready to guide an LLM in helping you complete your project. Would you like me to start implementing one (e.g., Prompt 2 for setup) or refine anything further?
