+ $ Mean, Median, Standard Deviation, PMF, PDF & CDF.
+ ? Yêu cầu viết note latex: Giải thích Variance và Mean dưới 2 góc nhìn. Coursera + AIO, Mathematic + Application/Machine_Learning


## 1. Basic Descriptive Statistics
**Mean and Expected Values**
+ ! Trung Bình (Median) là $\mu$ còn Mean (Xác suất / Giá trị kì vọng) là $E(X)$

**Median**



**Median (Trung vị) Application**
Image Denoising 


**Comapre Mean vs Median**


## 2. Advanced Descriptive Statistics
**Variance Overview**

## 3. Probability Theory
**Probability Distribution-Phân phối xác suất**

**Discrete and Continuous** (CDF - Cumulative distribution function) 
	Discrete (PMF - Probability Mass Function) 
	Continuous (PDF - Probability Density Function)

*PMF (Discrete) Example of Dice Rolle*

+ ? The empirical rule, also known as the 68–95–99.7 rule, is a guideline that applies to data following a normal distribution

## 4. Histogram

### Introduction to Histogram
What is Histogram and What can it do 

### Histogram Equalization
*HE Application & Example:*

*HE Example: Step by Step*

*HE Use Case*

**Extension: CLAHE** (HE but apply to each n by n GRID)
