Jump straight into problem solving mode trying to find the solution.
+ ? Problem: Slow other function down if encounter un-master subject. Making myself to confuse even more (e.g. make theory, psudo knowledge, etc..)
+ $ Sol: Focus on 1 thing: Eat then Digest, not simultaneously.
+ @ Conclude: Work perfectly, consumed what I learned right away. Turn out, I need to gather enough information to understand a concepts. (This works repeat until all concept consumed when I learning a chapter)

**Thought:**
+ My brain cannot return solutions for a concept if there aren't enough information to process, just like ML, too much information it will be overload making learning others concept difficult and slowed, too little information making conclude any concept impossible since their is no evidence.
+ To understand a concept, I have to gather enough amount of information in able to re-explain it clearly. When I wake up healthy and my brain is clear, its much easier to learns, does this mean my brain have more RAM in the morning, so **does learning too much decrease my brain's RAM because it cannot handle enough information to conclude a point?**


Everytime I receive (i.e. read, listen, see) sth I do not or merely understand  my brain distract itself by sth it understand and knowed. 
+ ? Might be Reason: In concentration mode, the brain must keep the stream of though flowing therefor it replace what need to be done with what can be done at the moment. 


+ ? Don't make thing complicated by not assume sth right without evidence. Math is all about simplify, remember "conclude" mean narrow down answers and problems.
