### Mein Speaking Outline

**Intro (3 slides)**
#### Part 1: Background, Experience, Interest, Current Focus, Reason to learn AI
*Slide 1 Background*
IT background, Bachelor's Degree in the next 3 months, I focusing on my graduation project so I not seeking employment right now.  

*Slide 2:  Experience*
I have experience in web development, in both front end and back end beside learning to be a AI Engineer. My pass work includes trainining machine learning model (Description about job), writing image processing algorithm with numpy to improve YOLO detection quality in Defect detection and pose estimation. 

*Slide 3: Reason for learning AI.* 
Improving Vietnam education system has been my goal since highschool so the moment I discovered how many things AI could do to advance world's education forward, I was instantly fascinated. 


**Part 2: Group work**
*Slide 4: Current Focus (job or study) - Who you are in AI world, AI Journey*
*Past Perfect: have + V3* (past perfect used for action that happened before action in the past or an action that started in the past and continuedup to another point in the past)
	V1 - have run, V2(-ed) had run, V3 - had run

*Reason for learning AI in detail*
Other than school (beyond my acedemic study), i started my "improve education" journey by working on a Multiple Choice Question Generation System project daily during noon...
*Acknowledge Experience*
..., other than coding and experimenting with RAG's features. I had also reapplied code from similar project to gain further insights. As I found learning about AI for education meaningful and the demand for fast-paced learning has risen, I am planning on adding more features based on future social survey. 

*Slide 5 Past Simple (was) to describe my AI Journey* 
When I was 14 years old, I was so inspired by Elon Musk that I started learning to code by solely on watching youtube turtorials on my father's laptop. 
The journey was tough for me as I'm not the brightest student. Ironically, my poor circumstance led me to understand all the hardships a student might face during their self-education journey such as managing sleep, emotions and energy.

*Slide 6 Future Simple/Near Future*
	*will + V1 (dự báo mong ước) / be going to V1 (dự định)*
In the next 3 - 5 years, I firmly believe that most repetive and laborious jobs will be replaced by robot and AI. 
*Compound word (từ nối) - word that connect 2 or more sentences together*
With that being said, social disorder may spread if there aren't sufficient job alternative to fill this gap.   
Note: aren't any job (implies no jb) -> sufficient job (implies there aren't enough job) 

Future AI Project name .... to help.... (community, specific group of people, ages)


**Slide 6: Contribution for AI community**
+ Tutorial for AI Science Research project i have done. (note: have done or had done)
+ Open source student research project

Hello everyone, my name is Dinh Nhat Thanh. I have an **IT background** and will receive my **Bachelor's Degree in the next three months**. Right now, I’m **focusing on my graduation project**, so I’m not actively looking for a job right now.

Throughout my journey, I’ve had **experience in web development, both front-end and back-end.** At the same time, I’ve been **pursuing my path as an AI Engineer**. My **previous work** includes training machine learning models, as well as **writing image processing algorithms using NumPy to improve** YOLO's **detection quality** in defect detection and pose estimation tasks.

The reason I chose AI is simple. Since high school, I’ve been **passionate about improving Vietnam’s education system**. When I discovered the **potential of AI** in transforming education worldwide, I knew it was the right path for me.

**Beyond academics**, I’ve **started working on an open-source project to generate multiple choice questions** using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). I spend my afternoons coding, testing, and learning from related projects. I **plan to expand the system using feedback** from real learners to make it even more adaptive.

This **journey actually began when I was 14**, inspired by Elon Musk. I learned to code from YouTube tutorials on my dad’s old laptop. It wasn’t easy—I **struggled with motivation, sleep, and emotional balance**. But it **helped me understand** some of the **challenges self-learners face.**

Looking ahead, I believe that in the **next 3 to 5 years**, many **repetitive jobs will be automated by AI** and robots. With that being said, I **hope to contribute to AI solutions** that not only **support education** but also offer **new career alternatives** to help people **adapt to this shift/changes in ours AI world today.**

That is my representation, Thankyou for listening
