## ConNeXt: A ConvNet for the 2020s - Paper Explain
**From ConvNets to ConvNeXts**
In ConvNeXt paper, ViT wa s mis-interpret by not training on augmentations -> This show with enough data, even a old model can achieve good accuracy.

+ ? ConNeXt author argue that the model should be comparing to the 2021 SoTA EfficientNet not 2015. 
+ $ In fact, EfficienNet does achieve better result. Look like EfficientNetV2 is the ConvNeXt of the 2020s.  ![[Pasted image 20260121123039.png]]


**ConvNeXt inspiration: Swin Transformers**
1x1 Convolution: maintain number of features while saving computation resource.
