I'd say AI will create a sustainable ecosystem for humans to live in the far future. Without worrying about food or living space, human have the freedom to entertain themselves with knowledge, learning what they want, do what they want, create what they want (not a fricking NUKE). As happy humans are more likely to contributed valued to society than "I have to do this" type of humans.

I grew up seeing a lot of people (ME + people I see) pursuing things that weren't aligned with their true interests which ended up making their times DEAD, during doom-scrolling, watching mindless entertainment, excessively drama consumption and activities where you feel like you doing something but you're not (remember literature in your 9th grades).

That's why I see AI is the right answer for a fulfilling life :)) Do more what you love, do less what you don't. Simple as that!

Think about it, A world where nobody sees learning new things as a burden while having a purpose of their own. How fast would the world develop and grows?
