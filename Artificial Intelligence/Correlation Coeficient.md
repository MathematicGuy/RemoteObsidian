Note: 
+ The Product mean 2 Histogram are correlated to each others. (Like in probability)
+ Variance show how spread the data is. large spread, large variance
+ **bin**: chosen color_range (Each color in color_range from 0 to 255, bins represent the maximum range you want to chose. e.g. bins=5 mean choosing color_range from 0 to 5.)
