# Learning how to Learn
ML **isn't about remembering memorizing algorithms, it about understanding data and patterns** bc technology are changing constantly, what's hot today might become obsolete tomorrow. 
-> **Problem solving is everything, ML is about breaking down complex problems and finding creative solutions.**
![[Pasted image 20241115110625.png]]

**CONFIDENCE**
+ Don't get paralyzed 
+ Breakdown problems
+ Look up solutions and find tools
+ Adapt quickly

**EFFICIENCY**
> Not everyone have to learn everything
![[Pasted image 20241115100145.png]]


**Figure out your Learning Styles**
> Some people need to understand the theory before applying it, some people need to apply it before learning theory.

>note: paper by BlueMango.

+ $ Constantly ask your self: 
	+ **WHY AM I DOING THIS ?** can this help me to become what I want to be
	+ **CAN I DO SOMETHING MORE USEFUL WITH MY TIMES ?** 

# Where to Start ?
**Python**
> Allow you to use code in days without learning all the complicated coding theory like pointers, memory allocation, garbage collection, etc..
![[Pasted image 20241115100606.png]]

**Learn Data Analysis** (Excel on steroid) 
>DA help growth these skills which could be inherent through many fields. Learn DS along with your current majors is the best bet.   
![[Pasted image 20241115110334.png]]

**Pandas** (like SQL using python)
+ ? Main tools for Data Clearning, Analysis, Transformation with powerful function for merging  , reshaping and analysing data.  
+ Numpy Arrays
+ Spreadsheet functionality
+ SQL database like joins
+ Built-in stats & plotting functionality
> Master at pandas -> Excel at data analysis.
![[Pasted image 20241115100820.png]]
+ ? Data Analysis and Preparation take up 60-80% of DS job. 


**Your First Data Analysis Project**
> Work on your first project to Deepen your understanding about data analysis and what you know. 
 + $  Real Project beat turtorials.
+ ? Find opensource data, read and understand the data and apply your skills. 


# ESSENTIAL MATH FOR ML
## Core Concepts
Linear Algebra Fundamentals
Statistics 
Calculus (especially Derivatives) 
+ How dervi work 
+ Deri rules

##  Focus on Intuition over proof
+ ? You need a working knowledge not a PhD (Focus on what matters most, then get PhD latter)

# The CORE ML CONCEPTS and ALGORITHMS
+ ? People often jump straight in Deep Learning, it was a mistake. 
**Spend most of your time on Simple Algorithms**
![[Pasted image 20241115102319.png]]
**Because they're:** 
• Quick to run
• More generalizable
• More interpretable
• Easier to communicate
• **Form the basis for more complicated Algos** (Neural Nets come from Linear Regression and Logistic Regression) 
  
---

Start from **"Linear, Logistic Regression" then "SVM"** then "**Decision Trees**" then "**Ensemble Algos**" 
![[Pasted image 20241115102443.png]]
Most of these topics are from the books
![[Pasted image 20241115102556.png]]
You can watch video from the book authors if prefer (for free)

(20 Hours total - estimate acquire times: 100 Hours - 2 to 3 weeks)

# Scikit-Learn Turtorial 
> can be learned within 1-2 days
+ Library allow you to toy with ML algorithms -> broaden your understanding before you building the algorithms from scratch. 

**The Genius Move**

### New ML Project
![[Pasted image 20241115112627.png]]

>Note that when **Performance Increases the Interpretability also increases. Your Goal is to find the sweet spot.** 
![[Pasted image 20241115112652.png]]
>Also don't  forget over fitting as you increase in  model complexity.  
![[Pasted image 20241115112732.png]]
>Keep validation and test sets aside before starting to model  and compare your models using the test set at the very end.

This is the best way to not stuck in the....

>Application of ML is to predict variables given some variables. ![[Pasted image 20241115112536.png]]

# COLLABORATE & SHARE 
>your project with others. Learning ML in Isolation is the slowest way to learn. 
![[Pasted image 20241115113705.png]]
> This will increase your learning progress 10 times.
+ $ The connections you form this way will not only help you learn better but boost your career in unexpected ways.

# ADVANCE TOPICS
![[Pasted image 20241115105614.png]]

**DO's And DONT'S**
 + ! Don't
	Get stuck in turtorial hell
	Rush and Ignore the Fundamentals
	Learn in Isolation
	Try to memorize everything
	Don't Copy-paste code without understanding
	Chase every new Trend 
	Try to learn every new fancy tool or research paper
 + $ Do
	Build real Project 
	Focus on Understanding (Intuition)
	Master the Fundamental first
	Collaboration and share your progress (build connection)
	Implement from scratch 
	Learn base on your need
