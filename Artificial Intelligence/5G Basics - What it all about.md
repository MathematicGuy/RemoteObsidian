### History of 5G
Each Generation last about 10 years. Between 3 and 4, 4 and 5 there a .5 version (i.e. 3.5 and 4.5)
2G allow users to send short messages. 
3G provided basic internet access like buying ticker online. 
4G was the first true internet, united global internet standard. 
5G is now, still in it early day. 

### Ahead of future needs: what 5G offer 4G don't have ?  
4.5G deliver 1GPBs. But not fast enough for newly emerging application like search and recue drone, need to connect to ML Vision AI.
ITU - International Communication Union from UN (United Nation) that oversees information and communication technilogies.

5G - set the broad lines in 2015. 

*ITU mandated that 5G should deliver 3 things:* 
eMBB - Enhanced mobile broadband. 
	20Gbps download, 10Gbps Upload. -> Need reliable management protocol to prevent Overload. like mMTC. 
mMTC - Massive machine-type communicatior.
	demand goes up -> need reliable connection for 1 million devices per 1 $km^2$ 
	-> Allow faster downlaod speed for large medical file, and allow delivery using drone within areas. 
URLLC - Ultra-reliable low latency communications.
	reduce latency by 90%
	Boost connection reliability to 99.999% 
	-> Allow communication between automation vehical (to avoid crashes)

### P3: Why Standard Matter ? 
Standards for evoluation toward 5.5G 
5G have huge adoptation in the future reaching up to 3.5bil in 2026. 

**Why Standard Matters ?**
	Allow devices from different companies, manufacturers in different country work together (interoperate).
	Ensure device compatibility and network safety. 
+ $ Allow cheaper scaling for global R&D and manufacturers. 
+ $ Avoid Fragmentation where each Country use a different protocol in 1990s like GSM in Europe and CDMA in US 
-> Essential for making 5G a global reality. 

**Main standards organizations**
![[Pasted image 20250926134203.png# left 455]]
ITU (International Telecommunication Union)
+ sets overall vision and framework for global communications. 
3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project)
+ Standardize technology -> Standard releases in stages called "releases" 
-> releases remain open for revision, then become 'frozen' (name in number like #18 for version 18)

Key 5G releases: 
- Release **15** **(Dec 2017): First 5G standard,** focused on **eMBB** (enhanced Mobile Broadband)
    
- Release **16** (**Summer 2020): Added massive MIMO**, clarified **ultra-reliable** low latency (URLLC) targets **(99.9999% reliability, 1 ms latency)**
    
- Release **17**: Broader tech coverage, **more MIMO and URLLC details**
    
- Release **18**: Marks **shift to 5.5G/5G Advanced**

5.5G / 5G Advanced
- Promises lower latency, faster uplink, more precise device location
- Enhanced support for advanced applications

**GSM and CDMA standards**
- **GSM**: 2G digital cellular standard, widely used in Europe and globally for voice/basic data
    
- **CDMA:** Competing 2G/3G standard, mostly US, allows multiple users per frequency band via unique codes
