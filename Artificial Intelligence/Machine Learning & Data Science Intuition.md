Understand the math -> deep understanding what the parameters do in ML (this is crucial) ![[Pasted image 20241022160948.png]]Help Finetune your Model much quickly. 

**Core Fomula (Understand what They Trying To Do)**

+ ? Also, asked question. Like what does 'best' in bestfit mean? for linear regression it mean its closest to the line in linear regression.

**Statistic & Probability**

+ $ Most of your intuition will be form by statistics and statistical significant, the size and quality of your datasets, proper model selection and so on. (Core of being a good Data Sciencetist)

Note: 
+ After learning Statistic, Read the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning"


# Can everybody learn math or are there limitations ?

**Math:** "Not know sth instantly? Well, work for it"
> The scariest thing is when you don't understand why you don't understand sth.
