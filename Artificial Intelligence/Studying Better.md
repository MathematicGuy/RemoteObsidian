# Obsession: a tingling feeling of wanting something so badly that nothing else can amuse one besides that one thing. In simple term, willing to do it than anyone else.

Don't feel like studying -> Study what I like first then eat the frog later
Do what I want when I don't see what I needs

Write down most important task in your days
Set a Fake Deadline

Batch similar tasks (in 1 sections) - do similar tasks in 1 go, don't do multiple task at one.


Eat in peace, no stimulant
Go to your bathroom without your phone
No Game 2hr before bedtime
