**Random Forest** - using multiple tree to prevent overfitting. 

**Auto-Encoder** 
Encode data into lower latent dimension to discourver data's hidden features. 
Why important 
1) premise (tiền đề)  for unsupervised learning. Open new doors for Machine to learn important features without labeling -> pre-train in deep learning.
2) Its Usage in data compression problems.
