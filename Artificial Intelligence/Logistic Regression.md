## BERNOULLI (distribution)
> A **Bernoulli distribution** is a discrete probability distribution that represents a random experiment with only two possible outcomes: **success** (usually denoted by 1) or **failure** (denoted by 0). The probability of success is denoted by $p$, and the probability of failure is $1−p$.
	
- **Definition**: A Bernoulli trial is an experiment where the outcome can either be a success (1) or failure (0), and the probability of success is ppp (where $0 \leq p \leq 1$).
    
- **Example**: Tossing a coin is a classic Bernoulli trial:
    
    - Success (Heads) with probability *ppp*
    - Failure (Tails) with probability $1 - p$

where:

- $X$ is the number of successes.
- $n$ is the number of trials.
- $k$ is the number of successes observed.
- $p$ is the probability of success in each trial.
