y = mx + b
+ m as slope (slope = rise / run) 
+ b as y-intercept (because it cut/cross y-axis off)
+ x & y as the coordiante
	
+ ? Example if $y = \frac{1}{2}x + 3$ then b will intercept 3 in y-axis. The slope m with m = 1/2 express as rise over run thus (x, y) = (1, 2)  ![[Pasted image 20240916171245.png]]
	
+ ? The same for m as -2, we have rise y = -2 and run x = 1	![[Pasted image 20240916171827.png]]
