+ ? This fomular often mentions in biology.
Population growth formulas allow us to determine the rate of population change with respect to certain variables- including population size, births, deaths, per capita growth rate, and carrying capacity.

$\frac{dN}{dt}$ mean the change in N over the change in time. with $r = 1$ (growth rate =1). The term follow the fomular:

Take rabbit growth for example, at time 0 we got rabbit population over time dN/dt equal 1.6
![[Pasted image 20241031141617.png]]
With dN/dt=1.6, total rabbit at time=1, N will be $2 \times 1.6=3.6$

continue until time=5, we see that as time increase the population reach a limit 9.99 and their growth over time come closer to 0.

## Why use "e" in the Sigmoid ?
+ $ Well, you can use any base number like $k^{-x}$ for sigmoid function and everything in ML or DS will remain the same, it just your notation get a little ugly. **By using e, we basically prettyfied/simplified the sigmoid function**
