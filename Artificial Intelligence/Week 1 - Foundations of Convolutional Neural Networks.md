**Strided Convolution**
Summarize Convolution (i.e. feature map) size

note: convolution sometime called as cross-correlation or convolution operator. 

## Convolutions Over Volume
**Conv and Kernel format:** Width $\times$ Height $\times$ Number of Channel (Depth)  
Ex: 6 blocks width x 6 blocks height x 6 colors channel ![[Pasted image 20241215144253.png]]
+ ? CNN's **parameters** are the weights and biases that the model learns during training. Each layer has its own set of parameters, which are determined based on its structure. 

Letâ€™s break down how to calculate parameters for **convolutional**, **pooling**, and **fully connected** layers. **Note that kernel depth is depend on it image number of channel.**  
+ $ The Convolution layers, **each kernel will go through it corresponding color channels** (e.g. 1st kernel layer for red, 2nd layers for green and 3rd layers for blue) -> This mean for 1 kernel total parameters is 3x3x3 + 1 bias  = 28 parameters. 
+ $ For multiple kernel/filters, we simple multiply them. We have 2 kernels so the 1st CONV layer total parameters is 28 * 2  = 56 parameters.   
**Total Parameters Fomula:**
$\text{Kernel's Parameter} =  F_{w}*F_{h}*C_{in} + 1$ where $C_{in}$ is the number of inputs channels.
$\text{Total Parameter} = (F_{w}*F_{h}*C_{in} + 1) * N_{f}$ where $N_{f}$ is the number of kernel 


For multiple kernel, we just multipli it. 84 * 2 = 168 parameters.
Thus, 1st Conv layers have 168 parameters.

+ (28, 28, 6) bc 32 - 5 + 1 = 28. Don't mistake kernel size with feature map depth / channel size.
+ `#parameters` is parameters of `filters = parameter_per_filter * total_filter`  
	Parameter per filter calc as $F_{w}*F_{h}*C_{in} + 1$ where $C_{in}$ is the number of inputs channels: $5.5.3 + 1 = 76$ * 6 because we have 6 filters, so 456 parameters in total.   
	
+ CNN use Average Pooling hence (5,5,6)
