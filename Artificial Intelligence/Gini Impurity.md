Gini Impurity using Gini Index, same as  Entropy its use to measure the inbalance in class distribution. This index can be calculate by substracting 1 (total prob) to the sum of squared percentages of each class (i.e. prob of each class):
$$Gini = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{C}p^{2}_{i}$$
The example below show the probability of the Leaf that is not both YES or both NO to happend. Let's go deeper fomula
