Paper Review on the Elastic Weight Consolidation Method.

Link to the Fisher Information Matrix Videos. I personally liked 1 compared to 2 even though 2 had better graphics:
1. [Intro to Fisher Matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m62I5_ow3O8&t=297s)

**EWC** help to **find optimal solution for both Task** A and B Gradient. As you can see without **no penalty, Model Gradient jump straight to Task B.**

### Fisher Information Matrix
1) [compliment to 2nd video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m62I5_ow3O8), explain why the log of the likelihood is used and how the Taylor expansion of the log likelihood relates to the hessian.
