Person correlation tell if a change in A corresponding to a change in B, whereas it a **Position (in the same direction, increase A increase B)** or **Negative (oppsite direction, increase A, decrease B).** Thus the value ranging from `-1` to `1` to describe their magnitude and direction where value in range
	+ `0 < |r| < 0.3` indicate **Weak** positive/negative correlation
	+ `0.3 < |r| < 0.7` indiate **Moderate** positive/negative correlation
	+ `0.7 < |r| < 1` indiate **Strong** positive/negative correlation

## How To Determine the Strength of Association

Pearson’s r ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 represents a perfect negative correlation, and 1 represents a perfect positive correlation. The closer the absolute value of r is to 1, the stronger the correlation, and the closer the absolute value is to 0, the weaker the correlation.

A strong correlation means a stronger association between the two variables. If X and Y are strongly correlated, knowing the value of X gives you more information about Y—and vice versa—compared to when the variables are weakly correlated.

### 1. Perfect Negative Correlation (r=-1)

A perfect negative correlation is an association between two variables where an increase in one is always associated with a perfectly proportional decrease in the other. In other words, the two variables have a perfectly proportional inverse relationship. The correlation coefficient for a perfectly negative correlation is -1.

### 2. Negative Correlation (-1≤ r <0)

A negative correlation is any inverse correlation where an increase in the value of X is associated with a decrease in the value of Y. For a negative correlation, Pearson’s r is less than 0 and greater than or equal to -1.

### 3. Zero Correlation (r=0)

A zero correlation indicates there is no observable linear relationship between your two variables. Knowing the values of X will not tell you anything about the value of Y.

### 4. Positive Correlation (0<r≤1)

A positive correlation is any correlation where an increase in the value of X is associated with an increase in the value of Y, and a decrease in the value of X is associated with a decrease in the value of Y. For a positive correlation, Pearson’s r will be greater than 0 or less than or equal to 1.

### 5. Perfect Positive Correlation (r=1)

A perfect positive correlation is an association between two variables where an increase in one is always associated with a perfectly proportional increase in the other. The correlation coefficient for a perfectly positive correlation is 1.
