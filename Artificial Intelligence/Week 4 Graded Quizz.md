+ If MM has size nn, then it has nn distinct eigenvalues - True
	Bc it have n answer, which is n eigenvalues

+ Singular -> Have only 1 answer. (chỉ có 1 nghiệm) which mean it have onlz 1 axis (x, y). Matrix require at least 2 axis so it cannot have identity matrix.

Apply Gaussian Elimination for Matrix Reduction to find the Rank (Rank - total result of the matrix. Số nghiệm của ma trận)
-> Rank 2

1) True. Since Reverse Matrix of M is just 1/M. So it Singular Remain
2) False. Because Determinant of a Square Matrix can be negative
3) False. Because only $\det(M)^{n}= 5^n$ 
4) Flase. Because eigenvalues of a Matrix can be duplicate.

1) True. Because X, Y, Z multiply by the row, in other word represent it. 
	e.g for the 1st column: x = 2, y = 1, z = 1
