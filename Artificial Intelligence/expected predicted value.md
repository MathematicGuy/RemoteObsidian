## Expected Value: Discrete Case
**Mean**: **average value of the whole sets (number)**. Rewrite the equation into probability out of 10 for age 0, 1, 2, 3 we got the fomular for Expected Value.

**Expected Value: Motivation Example 1** -  Maximum amount of money to bet for $5 on head.

**Expected Value: Motivation Example 2** - Maximum amount of money to bet where you flip 3 coins and win $1 for each heads. 
-> Flip 3 coins, half of them are head -> 1.5 dollars is the maximum price.

To conclude, $\mathbb{E}[X]$ (i.e. Expected Value) for discrete variable x will have the Probability Mass Function (PMF) that show the probability of each outcome X. The Expected value is the sum of x $(0,1,2,3)$ times the probability of x $\left( \frac{1}{8}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{3}{8}, \frac{1}{8} \right)$ for all possible values of x $(0, 1, 2, 3)$.

+ $ To visualize for discrete value, the **Expected Value is** the **Equilibrium point** of the Probability Mass Function. In simple term, average value point. (need to note more detail)

For **continuous variables**, it the **Equilibrium point** of the **Probability Dense Function**

### Example
>You collect data each time you waiting for the bus for many years and its each point of time are filled out (thus it Uniform Distributed) with the average of 30.

>For Uniform Distribution, $\mathbb{E}[X]$ always locate in the middle point since data are distributed equally.

**Common Misconception**: Expected value is not the center point. It the point where data are balance the most. Spread out data might look small but it bring a heavy punch.
