Algorithm 
Finding out a out of normal tree, finding the odd-one-out
Sherlock homes of ML

repeated until the point is isolated
split the data randomly
the point that get seperated faster is abnormaly
unique approach - directly target the abnormaly
	abnormaly are few and diff -> hence its abnormaly
