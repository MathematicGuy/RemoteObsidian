> Slope = 0 <-> f'(x) = 0 (since there is no accelaration)

p: head and 
(1-p): tail
Using possibility we have: $f(p) = p^{16} + (1-p)^4$ . To maximize the function we can either applied logarithm then use derivative . 
With logarithm, we have $16\log(p) + 4\log(1-p)$

**Example for the 2nd Statement:**
$$f(x)=e^{-x^{2}}$$ and
$$\log\left(e^{-x^{2}}\right)$$
