**Main Different between Supervised & Unsupervised & Reinforcement Learning:**
+ **Supervised Learning** learn then predict data based on the given labeled input dataset. (e.g. Classification, Time Series, Prediction, etc...)
+ **Unsupervised Learning** learn a unlabeled dataset in order to find patterns of the given dataset. (e.g. Segmentation, Categorizing, Identifying Pattern, etc...)
+ **Reinforcement Learning** is a ML technique that teach ML Model learns base on some set-of-polices that is reward-and-punishment. 

**CNN vs MLP**
	**CNN extract spatial features** (đặc trưng không gian) like **edges, textures and patters** while **MLP is less efficient at capturing spatial features** compared to CNNs even with features engineering.


### What the different between Keras, Tensorflow and Pytorch
+ **Keras** is a **high-level network API specialize in Deep Leraning** that integrated in TensorFlow. 

+ **TensorFlow** was developd for a **range of rask include math, machine learning** with **comprehensive ecosystem** of community resources, lib and **tools that facilitate building and deploying ML applications**. 

+ **PyTorch** is a **Deep Learning framework specialize in NLP.**
