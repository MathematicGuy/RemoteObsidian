When someone says, "The solution for this system has 0 degrees of freedom," they mean that there is a single, unique solution to the system of equations. Here's how to understand that in terms of degrees of freedom:

**What are Degrees of Freedom?**

- **In General:** Degrees of freedom often refer to the number of independent choices you could make to get all possible outcomes of a situation. Think about choosing a number: you have infinite choices (infinite degrees of freedom).
- **System of Equations:** In a system of equations, degrees of freedom usually refer to the number of variables whose values can be freely chosen (i.e., are not fully determined by the equations). This also dictates how many different solutions might be possible.

**Why 0 Degrees of Freedom Means a Unique Solution**

Consider a system with two equations and two unknowns (x and y):

- **2 Degrees of Freedom:** If neither equation fully determines a variable's value based on the other, you could choose a value for 'x' and then calculate the corresponding 'y' to get a solution. Similarly for a different choice of 'x'. You have freedom in selecting values for variables.
- **1 Degree of Freedom:** If one equation fully determines a variable (like y = 2x + 3), you still have freedom to choose the value of 'x'. Once you do, the value of 'y' is set (dependent on 'x').
- **0 Degrees of Freedom:** If _both_ variables are fully determined by the equations, there is no freedom in choosing their values. Therefore, there can only be a single solution.

**Examples:**

1. **2 Degrees of Freedom (Infinite Solutions)**
    
    ```
    x + y =  10
    ```
    
    You can choose any value for 'x' and find a corresponding 'y' that fits.
    
2. **1 Degree of Freedom (A Line of Solutions)**
    
    ```
    x + y = 10 
    y = 2x
    ```
    
    You can choose 'x', but then 'y' is determined. The solutions fall along a line.
    
3. **0 Degrees of Freedom (Single Solution)**
    
    ```
    x + y = 10
    2x - y = 5 
    ```
    

With two independent equations fully defining both 'x' and 'y', there's only one possible satisfying combination (a single point).

**In Summary**

- "0 degrees of freedom" means a unique solution exists.
- More degrees of freedom often imply a range of solutions (a line, a plane, etc.) or potentially no solutions.
