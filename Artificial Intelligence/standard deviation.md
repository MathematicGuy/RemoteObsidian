How much a standard person deviate from the means value -> Standard devisation

>  so standard deviation is the square root of the sum of values divided by the number of values. 

+ ? We substract the height of each person to the means and square that, divide all that by the number of people and square root all of that.

So on average people deviate 12.06 meters from the means.

### Why mean deviation ?
Isn't that I can just add up all the height and divide them by n. 
+ ? Because there're diff means values can cause negative result. Quadratic mean are guarantee to give positive result.

+ $ Say that you want to **calculating the standard deviation of "hours a person playing game" of the whole population**, you would take the **1st fomula** 
+ ? but if you just **take a group of people out of the population** as sample to estimate the deviation of the population using just the sample data. You use **2nd fomula**

### What is the difference between the variance and the standard deviation? 
+ ? The standard deviation is the average distance from the mean.

+ ? The variance is the squared average distance from the mean.

+ $ in other word **Standard Deviation is the root of the Variance** and in reverse **Variance is the Standard Deviation square.**
