The logarithm function makes $f(x)$ symmetric for $x = a$ and $x = \frac{1}{a}$ because of a key property of logarithms:


$$\log(a) = -\log\left(\frac{1}{a}\right).
$$

### Explanation:
1. **Logarithm Property**:
   The logarithmic identity states:
   $$
   \log\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) = \log(1) - \log(a) = 0 - \log(a) = -\log(a).
  $$
   Thus, the logarithm of the reciprocal of a number is the negative of the logarithm of the number itself.

2. **Symmetry**:
   Let $f(x) = \log(x)$. For $x = a$ and $x = \frac{1}{a}$:
   $$
   f(a) = \log(a), \quad f\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) = -\log(a).
  $$
   These values are negatives of each other, which means the function is symmetric about $\log(x) = 0$ (the $x = 1$ point).

3. **Implication**:
   For $x$ and $\frac{1}{x}$, the logarithmic values $\log(x)$ and $\log\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)$ have the same magnitude but opposite signs. This symmetry arises naturally because the logarithm function compresses numbers less than 1 and expands numbers greater than 1, creating balance around $x = 1$.

In summary, the logarithm introduces symmetry for $x = a$ and $x = \frac{1}{a}$ due to its inverse relationship with the reciprocal property.
