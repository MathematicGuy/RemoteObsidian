## II/ Vocabulary Practice: 
Some scientists believe that in the future computers will be more intelligent than human beings. While some see this as a positive development others worry about the negative consequences.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.
Remember and fill in the blanks:


```txt
Many today are w______________t the p_________________s of a______________________e. In my opinion, these c____________s are l______________e but o______________e A.I. will allow for n____________s to h______________________r.

The c____________________________________n its m___________e by humans i_____________y and machines later. The former is already c_______________s as a________________n has p______________t many t_____________________s. As artificial intelligence becomes more s______________d, the p______________________y will t_______________n from l__________________________f to d_________________s and other w_____________________s. The fear is that companies will be m____________________y by their b________________e, l_____________f many employees and t_____________________________t. Some also believe A.I. p__________________________________o the a________________________s of films like The Matrix and Terminator. This is a p________________y though it is impossible to e________________e its l_________________d.

The s__________________s above should be t__________________y but they p__________________________o the technologies A.I. can c____________________t. Companies r____________________m Google to Amazon to Tesla are i________________________y in this industry because of its e_______________________l. For example, s___________________s are f_______________________y and will reduce the number of v_____________________________y. P____________________s in government will be able to t__________________________________________s to p___________________________y and p_____________________e the lives of billions. In the c______________________e, smartphones will become i________________________l, f_______________p individuals to f____________________e on work, family, and l____________e. This is only a p________________t and the m__________________g and i________________________s have yet to be u______________d.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence p_____________s to the l__________________t and the future of humanity, but the opportunities for new projects should t_________________y. It is important to find a b_____________e and m____________s of m____________g the d___________s.

Tại sao lại cần token trống ? 
Xác định token quan trọng trong việc tính spam ? 

**Từ nào đc đánh giá quan trọng nhất trong việc tính toán spam score** -> tô đậm màu đỏ. 

Thay thế từng token đc tô đỏ (đc coi là dấu hiệu của Spam) bằng token trống -> giúp detect đc nếu token nào là quan trọng, vì khi token quan trọng biến mất thì điểm tự tin sẽ thấp.  

Áp dụng cái này thì áp dụng vào đâu. 
Vấn đề nằm ở Majority Voting chứ không phải do model kho detect đc -> vấn đề nằm ở việc Detect Kém.
