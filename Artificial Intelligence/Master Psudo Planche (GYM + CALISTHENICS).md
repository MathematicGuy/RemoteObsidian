# Muscle Hypertrophy
**What is Muscle Hypertrophy?**  
	Muscle hypertrophy is the process by which muscle fibers increase in size. This occurs when the muscles are exposed to mechanical stress (e.g., resistance training), which causes small amounts of damage. During recovery, the body repairs these fibers by fusing them, resulting in thicker, stronger muscles.

**note:** 
+ @ Don't Over Train. Because overtrain mean overrest, which disturb your workout routine. 
+ [[Smartest Way to Use Protein To Build Muscle]]
+ Don't do 2 set until failure, because overtrain mean less set to take. 

+ ! Never do more than 5 reps on warmups
+ @ Rest Time between 5 to 8 minutes. .
+ **Progressive Overload:** if you aim to do 12 reps and failed, next workout use the same weight, but if you succeed then add 2.5kg or 5kg to your next workout

+ $ **Rep Range:** 8 to 17 Rep.
	If achieve **17 then Increase Weight.** Before Lifting heavier weight, say 50kg. Build slowly from 30kg for Warm Up, rest 3 minutes, then do 50kg, rest 5 minutes.
+ ? **Workout Example 1:**
	+ warmup 5 reps, 20kg, 3 min rest
	+ warmup 5 reps, 25kg, 3 min rest
	+ 1st set 14 reps, 33kg, 7 min rest
	+ 2nd set 14 reps, 33kg, 7 min rest
	(If achieve 17 rep >> Increase Weight)
+ ? **Workout Example 2:** 
	Warmup sets: 
	+  25% max for 5 reps, rest 3 minutes. 
	+ 50% max for 5 reps, rest 3 minutes.
	Working sets:  
	+ 8-12 reps to failure, rest 5-7 minutes.
	+ 8-12 reps to failure, rest 5-7 minutes.
+ ? Routine
	Day 1 - PUSH DAY Weighted dips, incline bench, lateral raises.
	Day 2 - REST DAY Optional: walk/run.
	Day 3 - PULL DAY Weighted pull ups, cable rows.
	Day 4 - LEG DAY Squats, Hip thrusts, Hamstring curls, Calves raises. 
	Day 5 - REST DAY Optional: walk/run.

+ ? **Priority [REST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36bkuPKwvbU&t=324s):** rest 2 days for each muscle group. 
	![[Pasted image 20250207204304.png]]
+ ! **BASIC FIRST** - **Strength Before Skill:** Before Weighted, make **at least 15 Pullups & 20 dips**. 
	Weighted Dips always heavier weighted Pullup. 
	e.g. **40kg weighted dips <-> 20kg weighted pullups before** started **Calisthenics Skills** bc you would **progress so quickly. Like Muscle Up, etc.** 
+ ! **Avoid INJURY AT ALL COST:** when you feel like there a chance of injury, take thing slow, accept the defeat and go home, come back another day.  
+ Make sure you not Dehydration. 

note: 
+ **Hypertrophy:** Maximum muscle growth
+ **Strength:** Maximum strength growth
