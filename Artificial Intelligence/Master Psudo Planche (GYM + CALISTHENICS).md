# Muscle Hypertrophy
1) **What is Muscle Hypertrophy?**  
	Muscle hypertrophy is the process by which muscle fibers increase in size. This occurs when the muscles are exposed to mechanical stress (e.g., resistance training), which causes small amounts of damage. During recovery, the body repairs these fibers by fusing them, resulting in thicker, stronger muscles.
