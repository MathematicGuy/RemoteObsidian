In this context, $X$ represents the **matrix of input features** for all $m$ training examples. Here’s a detailed explanation of $X$:

### What is $X$?

- **$X$ is the input feature matrix** that organizes all the input vectors for the training examples.
- Each **column** of $X$ corresponds to the feature vector $x^{(i)}$ of a single training example.
- The **rows** of $X$ correspond to the individual features for each example.

#### Dimensions of $X$:
You stated that $X$ has the shape $(2 \times m)$, meaning:
- **2 rows**: This indicates that there are 2 features per example.
- **$m$ columns**: Each column represents one example, and there are $m$ examples in total.

So, in this case, $X$ is a **$2 \times m$ matrix**, where:
- Each column $x^{(i)} = \begin{bmatrix}x_1^{(i)} \\ x_2^{(i)}\end{bmatrix}$ is the feature vector for the $i$-th example. 
  - $x_1^{(i)}$: the first feature of the $i$-th example.
  - $x_2^{(i)}$: the second feature of the $i$-th example.

### Example of $X$:
Let’s assume you have two features (height and weight), and $m = 3$ examples. The matrix $X$ might look something like this:
$$
X = \begin{bmatrix} 
x_1^{(1)} & x_1^{(2)} & x_1^{(3)} \\
x_2^{(1)} & x_2^{(2)} & x_2^{(3)}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Where:
- $x_1^{(1)}, x_1^{(2)}, x_1^{(3)}$ are the values of the first feature (height) for examples 1, 2, and 3.
- $x_2^{(1)}, x_2^{(2)}, x_2^{(3)}$ are the values of the second feature (weight) for examples 1, 2, and 3.

So each column in $X$ represents one complete example, while each row represents one specific feature across all examples.

### Matrix Multiplications in Neural Networks:
In your expressions:

1. **$Z^{[1]} = W^{[1]} X + b^{[1]}$**:
   - $W^{[1]}$ has the shape $(n_h \times 2)$, where $n_h$ is the number of hidden units (neurons) in the hidden layer, and `2` is the number of input features.
   - $X$ has the shape $(2 \times m)$, where `2` is the number of input features and $m$ is the number of examples.
   - The multiplication $W^{[1]} X$ produces a matrix of shape $(n_h \times m)$.
   - $b^{[1]}$, the bias for the hidden layer, is broadcasted to shape $(n_h \times m)$ and added element-wise.

2. **$A^{[1]} = \sigma(Z^{[1]})$**:
   - $A^{[1]}$ is the activation matrix after applying the non-linear activation function $\sigma$ to $Z^{[1]}$. It has the same shape as $Z^{[1]}$, which is $(n_h \times m)$.

3. **$Z^{[2]} = W^{[2]} A^{[1]} + b^{[2]}$**:
   - $W^{[2]}$ has the shape $(n_y \times n_h)$, where $n_y$ is the number of output units (typically 1 for binary classification) and $n_h$ is the number of hidden units.
   - $A^{[1]}$ has the shape $(n_h \times m)$.
   - The result of $W^{[2]} A^{[1]}$ will have the shape $(n_y \times m)$.
   - $b^{[2]}$, the bias for the output layer, is broadcasted to shape $(n_y \times m)$ and added element-wise.

4. **$A^{[2]} = \sigma(Z^{[2]})$**:
   - $A^{[2]}$ is the final output of the network, representing the predictions for each example. It has the shape $(n_y \times m)$, which in binary classification is $(1 \times m)$.

### Summary of $X$ in This Context:
- $X$ is the **input matrix** of shape $(2 \times m)$, where:
  - **2** is the number of features per example.
  - **$m$** is the number of training examples.
- Each column in $X$ corresponds to the feature vector for one example.
- Each row corresponds to one feature for all examples.
