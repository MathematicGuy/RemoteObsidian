Standardization will turn data into this

+ ! This is not normal distribution. Bc it a linear transformation

x1 is small and x2 is big -> theta1 small and theta2 big

## Z-Scores
Z Board: Let me determine the distribution between 0 and 1 using the Area to the Left which is the sum of $z_{x}$ and $z_{y}$ coordinate. 
Ex: z = 0.507 then I choose $z_{x}=0.07$  and $z_{y}=0.5$

Deviation: độ lệch (tốc độ tăng trưởng của z/ khoảng cách tương đối giữa các điểm) 
Mean: giá trị trung bình của các điểm.

Let Convert the value to find the distribution for X < 49
![[Pasted image 20240719092643.png]]

For X in between in this example: 5.81 < X < 6.3. We just need to substract the smaller area to the bigger area. (Since the bigger area contain the smaller area. thus subtract the smaller will return us the between area)
> To solve this:
> 1) Standardization the Distribution using Z-Scores.
> 2) Subtract 2 standardized area. Done
