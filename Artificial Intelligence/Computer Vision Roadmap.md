1) Object Detection 
2) Image Classification
3) Advance Image Detection

Lesson Roadmap:
+ Fundamentals: 
	+ Definition
	+ Examples
	+ Ideal conditions
		+ Most common metrics
			+ Training: Loss Function
			+ Evaluation Metric: 
				**IoU** (intersection over union) 
				![[Pasted image 20241120155701.png]]  
				[[mAP (mean average precision)]]
		+ We will assum the data we use to train the model is **perfect**
			+ Many samples
			+ Equally distributed
			+ Perfectly annotated
+ Advanced
	+ Real life conditions
