# Determinants In-depth (định thức hiểu sâu)

## Singularity and rank of linear transformations
The image is Singular. it not covering the whole plane on the right, just a portion of it (**singular: matrix -> a line, a point**)

The rank of the matrix mean it Dimension.

What if the determinant is negative

Depending on what order we take 2 basis vectors as follows.

+ ? Negative value doesn't affect the singuality of the matrix. The only that affect is when the determinant is 0.

**Determinant** of a  product
it like multiplication for matrices. It blow up the area of a matrix.

Matrix A: 
[2 3] [4 1]

Matrix B: [5 6] [2 3]

Singular matrix  * any matrix -> singular matrix. Why?
