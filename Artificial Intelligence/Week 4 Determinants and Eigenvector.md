# Determinants In-depth (định thức hiểu sâu)

## Singularity and rank of linear transformations
The image is Singular. it not covering the whole plane on the right, just a portion of it (**singular: matrix -> a line, a point**)

The rank of the matrix mean it Dimension.

Depending on what order we take 2 basis vectors as follows.

+ ? Negative value doesn't affect the singuality of the matrix. The only that affect is when the determinant is 0.
