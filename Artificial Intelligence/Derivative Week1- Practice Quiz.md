Because the Derivative of Line 2 > Line 1

Choose 2 random point of x and calculate Derivative of a line which is 
$$
\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}
$$

The 3rd one is Dis-Continuos and the 4th one have just 1 point therefor cannot calculate the Derivative (require at least 2 Points)

The Slope is the Derivative of function (y1, y2) and $y_{1}', y_{2}'$ is a and c. There for 1) is True, 3) Is True and 3) is True.

$f'(X)$ describe the rate of change in time -> positive -> increase through time -> f increasing
