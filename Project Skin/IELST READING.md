**Achievements** (thành tích) - refers to the outcomes they attain through their efforts. If the learner improve, their achievement improve. (thành tích là học giỏi hơn)

**paragraph C:**
Much of the discussion about implementing e-learning has focused on the technology, but as Driscoll and others have reminded us, e-learning is not just about the technology, but also many human factors. As any capable manager knows, teaching employees new skills is critical to a smoothly run business. Having said that, however, the traditional route of classroom instruction runs the risk of being expensive, slow and, oftentimes, ineffective. Perhaps the classroom’s greatest disadvantage is the fact that it takes employees out of their jobs. Every minute an employee is sitting in a classroom training session is a minute they’re not out on the floor working. It now looks as if there is a way to circumvent these traditional training drawbacks. **E-training promises more effective teaching techniques by integrating audio, video, animation, text and interactive materials** (*promise something in the future -> hence advance equipments*) with the intent of teaching each student at his or her own pace. **In addition to higher performance results,** there are **other immediate benefits to students such as increased time on task, higher levels of motivation, and reduced test anxiety for many learners.** -> Performance improvements mean learner achievement


+ $ B -> E-learning wins as a **priority for many corporations** as its flexibility.
+ ? In addition to generally positive economic benefits, other advantages such as convenience, standardized delivery, self-paced learning, and a variety of available content, **have made e-learning a high priority for many corporations.** ....

+ $ D -> Example of **fast electronic delivery for a company’s products** to its customer
+ ? ...Today, over half of the 400-plus **courses that Rockwell Collins offers are delivered instantly to its clients in an e-learning format, a change that has reduced its annual training costs by 40%.** Many other success stories exist.


**Hereditary**  di truyền
**Hereditary condition** tình trạng di truyền 

+ $ E -> information about a study that suggests **synaesthetic symptoms aren’t arbitrary.**
+ ?  ...This was particularly peculiar **as synaesthesia is predominantly considered to be a hereditary condition** (*show a lack of understanding before*), and **the findings suggested that** (*the Finding prove synaesthetic no longer a mystery*) a synaesthete’s environment might play a determining role in establishing synaesthetic associations. If that was true, researchers asked, then might it not be possible that synaesthesia can actually be taught?


 + $ G -> a prediction for the **future of synaesthesia**
 + ? There is obviously **still a long way to go** (*show the looking forward intent*) **before we can fully understand synaesthesia and what causes it** (*intend for future development*). Once we do, however, it might not be too long before we find out how to teach non-synaesthetes how to imitate its symptoms in a way that induces the same benefits 4.4% of the world’s population currently enjoy.

Choose **ONE WORD ONLY** from the passage for each answer.
Recent research has suggested that teaching synaesthesia to non-synaesthetes can enhance *~~cognition~~ -> memory (bc the follow-up ideas mention the improvement for cognitive already)* and guard against the *deterioration (already mean decline)* of cognitive *~~decline~~ -> function*  unfortunately, it might be a while before we come up with a beneficial way to *teach* it to the general population.

infringement - violation (sự vi phạm) 
adequately - đủ (enough in a manor way)
substantial - significant / considerable amount of sth (đáng kể)
+ $ C. Warner Schaie - Being open to new ways of doing things can have a positive impact on your mental condition as we get older
+ $ B. Marion Diamond - Both animals and humans need to exist in an environment full of interest.
 *Lesson learned: pay close attention to similar ideas, and words that differentiate those ideas*
+ ? ...For example,'when a rat is kept in isolation, the animal's brain shrinks, but if we put that rat with other rats in a large cage and give them an assortment of toys, we can show, after four days, significant differences in its brain.'says Diamond. After a month in the enriched surroundings, the whole cerebral cortex has expanded, as has its blood supply. '**But even in the enriched surroundings, rats get bored unless the toys are varied. Animals are just like we are. They need stimulation**,'says **Diamond**. **A busy mental lifestyle keeps the human mind fit,** *just like human are -> both animals & humans*) says **Warner Schaie** of Penn State University. **‘People who regularly participate in challenging tasks retain their intellectual abilities better than mental couch potatoes.'** -> "*regularly participate" give "open to new way" idea.* 



+ $ *~~NOT GIVEN~~ -> FALSE* - Most nongovernment-owned seed banks are bigger than Seed Savers Exchange. (*as long as the context mentioned, its FALSE, not NOT GIVEN*)
+ ?  It is home to the Seed Savers Exchange, one of the largest non government-owned seed banks in the United States.

**Public awareness**
- $ while people know about plants disappearing from *~~food supply~~ -> rainforest* very few know about the decline in fruit and vegetable varieties.
- ? ...It’s also a campaign to protect the world’s future food supply. Most people in the well-fed world give little thought to where their food comes from or how it’s grown. They wander through well-stocked supermarkets without realizing that there may be problem ahead.We’ve been hearing for some time about **the loss of flora and fauna in our rainforests. Very little,by contrast,is being said or done about the parallel decline in the diversity of the foods we eat.** *make sure to determine the correct word by its following context, not just by the contexts before its*

One reason given by the writer for opposing fluoridation is that
- **~~A~~** it may contribute to tooth decay
- B it will be unacceptably expensive for the public.
- *C* obligatory fluoridation takes away personal freedom.
- D excessive fluoride could be added to the water by mistake.
	
+ ? **Three main grounds** for opposition to fluoridation have been expressed. First, **opponents claim the benefits are exaggerated or not established.** Second, **there are claims of health risks to pans of the population, for example, allergic reactions**. It is also accepted that high levels of fluoride can cause discoloration of otherwise healthy teeth. Proponents do not consider this to be a problem in such small concentrations, **whereas opponents disagree** - especially because some people drink more water and obtain much more than the standard 1 milligram of fluoride per day. Third, **fluoridation is thought to be an infringement on individual rights because it is compulsory medication of all members of a community.** (*only the 3rd claim existed in the list*)

What did Sutton's research discover about earlier studies in North America?
- *A* There were failings in the way they were carried out.
- ~~B~~ The scientists involved had achieved unique results.
- C Proponents of fluoridation had not understood its long-term effects.
- D Fluoridation had a greater effect on tooth decay than previously believed.
	
+ ?  **Sutton's detailed study throws doubt as to the extent of reductions in tooth decay from fluoridation.** Yet Sutton's book is not cited in a single analysis of the fluoridation issue by any sociologist. **In a situation of some scientific uncertainty,** differences in values are highlighted. A supporter of fluoridation might argue. 

In the last paragraph, what does the writer say about scientists?
- A They should reveal their true motivations.
- *B* They should not decide the **fluoridation policy.**
- ~~C~~ They are solely concerned with scientific truths.
- D They cannot reach agreement on the fluoridation issue.
	
+ ? From the sociological point of view, opposition to fluoridation is not necessarily irrational. Rather, claims to rationality and to scientific authority are better seen as part of a strategy to promote fluoridation than as incontrovertible statements of fact. **Second, social values are likely to be bound up in any decision about fluoridation, so this is not an issue on which declarations** (*on which declaration -> not under anyone's authority, hence policy*)

~~NOT GIVEN~~ *-> YES* Many sociologists have disregarded the doubts that some scientists have concerning fluoridation.

~~YES~~ *-> NOT GIVEN* - Sutton's findings have been given insufficient attention by scientists outside of North America.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|A|the results of scientific research are not always understood at first|
|B|scientific knowledge is based on experiments conducted by scientists.|
|C|people should be able to choose whether they want fluoride.|
|D|there is insufficient proof to support a cautious approach.|
|E|the serious damage fluoride causes far outweighs any positive effects.|
A sociological view of science argues that ~~A~~ *-> G*
The writer suggests that an opponent of fluoridation may conclude that -> ~~E~~ -> *C*
