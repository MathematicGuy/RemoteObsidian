**Achievements** (thành tích) - refers to the outcomes they attain through their efforts. If the learner improve, their achievement improve. (thành tích là học giỏi hơn)

**paragraph C:**
Much of the discussion about implementing e-learning has focused on the technology, but as Driscoll and others have reminded us, e-learning is not just about the technology, but also many human factors. As any capable manager knows, teaching employees new skills is critical to a smoothly run business. Having said that, however, the traditional route of classroom instruction runs the risk of being expensive, slow and, oftentimes, ineffective. Perhaps the classroom’s greatest disadvantage is the fact that it takes employees out of their jobs. Every minute an employee is sitting in a classroom training session is a minute they’re not out on the floor working. It now looks as if there is a way to circumvent these traditional training drawbacks. **E-training promises more effective teaching techniques by integrating audio, video, animation, text and interactive materials** with the intent of teaching each student at his or her own pace. **In addition to higher performance results,** there are **other immediate benefits to students such as increased time on task, higher levels of motivation, and reduced test anxiety for many learners.** -> Performance improvements mean learner achievement


+ $ B -> E-learning wins as a **priority for many corporations** as its flexibility.
+ ? In addition to generally positive economic benefits, other advantages such as convenience, standardized delivery, self-paced learning, and a variety of available content, **have made e-learning a high priority for many corporations.** ....

+ $ D -> Example of **fast electronic delivery for a company’s products** to its customer
+ ? ...Today, over half of the 400-plus **courses that Rockwell Collins offers are delivered instantly to its clients in an e-learning format, a change that has reduced its annual training costs by 40%.** Many other success stories exist.


**Hereditary**  di truyền
**Hereditary condition** tình trạng di truyền 

+ $ E -> information about a study that suggests **synaesthetic symptoms aren’t arbitrary.**
+ ?  ...This was particularly peculiar **as synaesthesia is predominantly considered to be a hereditary condition** (*show a lack of understanding before*), and **the findings suggested that** (*the Finding prove synaesthetic no longer a mystery*) a synaesthete’s environment might play a determining role in establishing synaesthetic associations. If that was true, researchers asked, then might it not be possible that synaesthesia can actually be taught?


 + $ G -> a prediction for the **future of synaesthesia**
 + ? There is obviously **still a long way to go** (*show the looking forward intent*) **before we can fully understand synaesthesia and what causes it** (*intend for future development*). Once we do, however, it might not be too long before we find out how to teach non-synaesthetes how to imitate its symptoms in a way that induces the same benefits 4.4% of the world’s population currently enjoy.

Choose **ONE WORD ONLY** from the passage for each answer.
Recent research has suggested that teaching synaesthesia to non-synaesthetes can enhance *~~cognition~~ -> memory (bc the follow-up ideas mention the improvement for cognitive already)* and guard against the *deterioration (already mean decline)* of cognitive *~~decline~~ -> function*  unfortunately, it might be a while before we come up with a beneficial way to *teach* it to the general population.
