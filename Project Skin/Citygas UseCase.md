**Exercise: Citygasâ€”Use-Case Model**
Citygas is designing a new billing system. For business customers, meter readers read the meter monthly.  For residential customers, some require a meter reader to read the meter monthly, while others enter their meter reading directly into the system over the telephone. The meter readers enter the meter readings into handheld devices that upload the meter reading wirelessly to the billing system.

The meter readings are used to prepare a bill that is sent to the customer. Payments can be made by cheque or by autopay. For a cheque payment, a clerk records the payments in the system and then the payment is deposited in the bank. For autopay payments, the banks send a daily electronic statement of payments received to the billing system.

Special meter readings are required when a customer sells a building or a flat and turns over possession to the new owner. These have to be calculated and billed separately to reflect a bill for part of a month. A special reading is also provided when a meter is repaired or replaced. A separate bill is not prepared in these cases.

The accounting department is provided with a daily summary of payments received and a weekly list of bills unpaid for ninety days.  The accounting department tries to collect unpaid bills. If they are not successful, they cut off service and send the billing department a notice to terminate the account.

**From the above requirements statement, construct a context use-case diagram that shows all required actors and their associated uses cases.**
