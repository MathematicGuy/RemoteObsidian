> The Leader need to have close relationship with their follower and make them feel comfortable toward them.

```ad-success
By telling them you expect great performance, 
the chances are you're going to deliver great performance.
Vice-versa if you tell them you don't expect much,
the chances are they won't give you much.

Styles -> conistent pattern that characterize the leader
**Model Complexity**
![[Pasted image 20240331032225.png]]
**1 way of communication:** Tell empl what to do. Only about the Production.  
![[Pasted image 20240331032232.png]]

**2 way communication** at all time: Encorage the team to express their ideas and Listen.
![[Pasted image 20240331032248.png]]

**Step away, empl make their own decision:** Allow member to make their own decision. No involment at all
![[Pasted image 20240331032301.png]]

Can do both at the same time. What ever fit best for the situation
> Create a leading Model and implemented base on the situation.


### Leadership grid
![[Pasted image 20240331033023.png]]
**Impoverished management: quản lý yếu**
	not offering any value
**Authority Compliance**
	Just want the job done, don't care about empl
**Country club management**
	Focus on maintaining relationship rather than complete the task
**Middle-of-road management** 
	 Strive the sastisfitory level of complete
**Team management**
	Team leader, maximum level of production and their care to the people.


```ad-note
It was that organisations needed people who could lead production and
people who could lead people.
```
+ ? A Leader can navigate across all these style. But it be better having multiple people specializing in these various different leadership areas, combining to lead an organization
  -> This is called Co-leadership

+ ! Knowing when to step in and when to step back is a importance job of being a leader.

**Exercise 1: Leader behaviour**
> Think about a past work experience where you felt empowered, autonomous, and professionally respected. Who was your supervisor? Thinking about your supervisor's behaviours, how would you classify their leadership style? In your response, ensure you justify your claims with evidence (e.g. example of behaviour) and reference to leadership theory, classifications, and paradigms.
+ Thay Huy is Delegative which mean leaving student to do most of the work without much guidace. However he absolutly suitable for Theory Y leader since he believe a lot in his student and what they can actually achieve which motivated them a lot. In the Pygmalion effect he successfully achieve the first three in the right but fail to achieve the last two. I think he get a 5 for being concern about his students progres and 4 in the concern for production in the Leadership grid.
