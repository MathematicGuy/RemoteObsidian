# Full Planche Workout Routine

### Important Considerations

- Nutrition: A full planche requires immense strength. Make sure you're nourishing your body with plenty of protein and healthy foods to support muscle growth and recovery.
    
- Rest: Your workout is intense! Proper rest is essential to avoid injury and allow for sufficient muscle recovery.
    

  

### Enhanced Warm-up (5 minutes)

- Dynamic stretches: Arm circles, torso twists, leg swings
    
- Joint rotations: Wrists, elbows, shoulders, ankles
    
- Light cardio: Jogging in place, high knees
    

  

### Planche-Focused Workout (20 minutes)

#### 1. Planche Lean Holds:  

- Find a smooth wall or sturdy object to lean against.
    
- Place hands shoulder-width apart, lean forward until shoulders are in front of wrists.
    
- Keep body straight, core tight, and push away from the surface.
    
- Hold 3 sets of 10-15 seconds (progress to longer holds over time).
    

  

#### 2. Tuck Planche Holds  
      
    

- On an elevated surface (parallettes or boxes), assume push-up position.
    
- Lean forward like the planche lean, but bring knees to chest.
    
- Hold 3 sets for 10-15 seconds (increase hold time as you get stronger).
    

  

#### 3. Pike Push-ups:  
      
    

- Start in a downward dog position (hips high).
    
- Keeping legs straight, lower your upper body towards the floor, head aiming between hands.
    
- Push back up to starting position.
    
- Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.
    

  

#### 4. Pseudo Planche Push-ups:  
      
    

- Normal push-up position, but lean forward further, placing more weight on hands.
    
- This mimics the forward body position of a planche.
    
- Do 3 sets of as many controlled reps as possible.
    

  

#### 5. Scapular Strength (choose 1-2 exercises):  
      
    

- Scapular shrugs: Focus on shoulder blade depression. (3 sets of 10-12)
   
- Scapular Pull-ups: Start from dead hang, pull shoulder blades down and together. Hold at the top (3 sets of as many as possible).
 

#### ALTERNATIVE

  

#### 1. Push-up Plus

- Setup: Get in a standard push-up position with your hands on the push-up bars.
    
- Movement: Perform a regular push-up, and at the top of the movement, push yourself further upward. Protract your shoulder blades (push them apart) for additional scapular activation.
    
- Focus: Feel the squeeze between your shoulder blades as you protract at the top.
    

#### 2. Dip Shrugs

- Setup: Position yourself on the push-up bars in a dip position, arms straight, body upright.
    
- Movement: While keeping your arms straight, focus on depressing your shoulder blades (pulling them down). Don't let your body sink significantly – focus on the shoulder movement.
    
- Focus: Imagine trying to pull your shoulders down towards your hips.
    

#### 3. Push-up Bar Scapular Pulls

- Setup: Place push-up bars wider than shoulder-width. Assume a push-up position with your hands on the bars.
    
- Movement: Keeping arms straight, focus on pulling your shoulder blades together (retraction). Your chest will move slightly towards the floor. Hold briefly and return to the starting position.
    
- Focus: Think about squeezing your shoulder blades together.
    

#### 4. Pseudo Planche Dips

- Setup: This is more advanced. Position yourself in a standard dip position on the bars.
    
- Movement: Slowly lower yourself, while simultaneously leaning your entire torso forward. This increases the load on the shoulders and requires excellent scapular control.
    
- Focus: Maintain a rigid plank-like body position during the movement.
    
  

### Cooldown (5 minutes)

- Static stretches: hold each stretch 30 seconds, focus on shoulders, chest, wrists, hamstrings.
    
  

### Important Notes

- Form is crucial: Watch videos and tutorials on proper planche progressions to ensure the right technique. Incorrect form can lead to injury.
    
- Progression: Slowly increase sets, reps, and hold times as you get stronger. Listen to your body – some days it's okay to reduce the intensity if fatigued.
    
- Wrist Safety: Warm up wrists thoroughly before training. Consider wrist wraps for extra support.
    

Frequency: Do this routine 3-4 times a week on non-consecutive days. Allow for rest days in between workout sessions.
