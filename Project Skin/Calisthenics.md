Planche-Focused Workout (20 minutes)

Planche Lean Holds:

Find a smooth wall or sturdy object to lean against.

Place hands shoulder-width apart, lean forward until shoulders are in front of wrists.

Keep body straight, core tight, and push away from the surface.

Hold 3 sets of 10-15 seconds (progress to longer holds over time).

  

Tuck Planche Holds:

On an elevated surface (parallettes or boxes), assume push-up position.

Lean forward like the planche lean, but bring knees to chest.

Hold 3 sets for 10-15 seconds (increase hold time as you get stronger).

  

Pike Push-ups:

Start in a downward dog position (hips high).

Keeping legs straight, lower your upper body towards the floor, head aiming between hands.

Push back up to starting position.

Do 3 sets of 8-12 reps.

Pseudo Planche Push-ups:

Normal push-up position, but lean forward further, placing more weight on hands.

This mimics the forward body position of a planche.

Do 3 sets of as many controlled reps as possible.
