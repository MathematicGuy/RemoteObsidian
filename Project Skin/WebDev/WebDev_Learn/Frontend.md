[[FrontEnd RoadMap]]

+ [[HTML]]: HyperText Markup language -> Add content to webpage.
+ [[CSS]]: Cascading Style Sheet -> Style webpage, make it look good. 
+ [[JS]]: Java Script -> Make web interactive.

*But then Google Chrome just understamd JS so we need to Transpile code back to JS using:*

*CSS also "missing useful features" and "can't organize code into different files" so we use*:
**Sass (a Preprocessor =  Bundler and  Transpiler)**
	+ Lets us organize our CSS into different files 
	+ Lets us write enhanced CSS (CSS with more features) 
	+ Then compile codes back to CSS.
