### THE TRUTH About the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict

(Biggest Televison in West Bank) - Encourage people to kill Jews.  

Ben Shapiro release multiple videos that inaccuracies 
	+ 1920 Ben refer Jordan  a part of Palestine
Arab has rejected peace everytime it bene offered to them?

Palestine was  a name made to insult jews (long time ago) 

Why Palestine-The Arabs reject to co-exist with Isreal?
	As far as I know the Britain give Isreal the Land that already have inhabitants. Not " A Land for people for a people without a land" 
	+ Too much Isreal moving to Palestine states? Disagreement then war ?
	+ 

Two states solution? why they not come to an agreement.
	+ Because one side (Arabs, Palestine, etc..) said there will be no peace
	+ No Peace, No Recognition, No Negociations.
While Isreal has accepted all the single peace deal provided to it. Moral Equivelent?
Plus, there has been a peace deal for a 2 state solution between Isreal an Palestine.(Arafat + Ehud Barak + Bill Clinton)
	Massive round of violen after the peace deal. Yes it true
Concession: nhượng bộ
Overtures: đề nghị

(Borrowed from a friend)
A little more history for those wanting to 'restore Palestine'.
In 132 AD the Emperor Hadrian resolved to stamp the Jews and their religion out of existence. He sold all Jewish prisoners into slavery after the revolt of Bar Kikhba, forbade the teaching of the Torah, renamed the province Syria Palaestina, and changed Jerusalem’s name to Aelia Capitolina. He renamed Israel to wipe out the national identity of Israel and the Jews.
So if you are looking to 'restore Palestine to the Palestinians', you need to give it back to the Jews.
