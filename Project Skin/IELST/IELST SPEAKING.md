Moreover

Alternative to But
	That Said
	On the Other Hand 

Alternative to AND, ALSO:
	additionally
	furthermore
	moreover
	nevertheless

As far as I know
I'm sure

Instead of saying firstly, secondly, thirdly -> say "Well, first of all"
Besides 

*Should use in Part 3:* Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover, Nevertheless -> avoid when asnwering simple questions about yourself. 

That said
![[Pasted image 20250529130741.png]]

As a matter of fact -> use when "give out a counter statement"

data - 
loud -> loudness
oschestra -
