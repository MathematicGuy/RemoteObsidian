Alternative to But
	That Said
	On the Other Hand 

Alternative to AND, ALSO:
	additionally
	furthermore
	moreover
	nevertheless

As far as I know
I'm sure

Instead of saying firstly, secondly, thirdly -> say "Well, first of all"
Besides 

*Should use in Part 3:* Additionally, Furthermore, Moreover, Nevertheless -> avoid when asnwering simple questions about yourself. 

That said

As a matter of fact -> use when "give out a counter statement"

## IELST Before Test, what to prepare
Need to prepare these 2 things before entering the test:

### 1. Model Subjects
**Themes**
![[Pasted image 20250530183609.png]]
+ ? **Choose a Subject first for any topics** so you always know what to say.![[Pasted image 20250530183722.png]]

+ ? For PEOPLE topic as example:
Come up with a short description of your model subject:
**Name:** Mr. Bean
**What he does:** Comedian
**A highlight about him:** funny guy

+ ? For THINGS topic as example:
The same as PEOPLE:
**NAME:** watch
**What it does:** show me times, what date is it, alarm important events
**A highlight about it:** the timepiece was the first prize of a lucky draws my father play.
+ $ Describe a gadget you use everyday:

`First Version` 
"There are many gadgets I can't live without, however if I have to choose it would be a timepiece, specifically my G-Shock watch. It's the item that save me countless time from getting late to school and allows me to be punctual every single day. Moreover, that watch was passed down to me by my father" 
+ **Feedback:** Describe the watch more details
+ **Share a story:"** Life improvement Before & After having the watch. 

`Improve Version:` 
"Without my top 5 essential gadget I my live would be the same, if I have to choose one a Timepiece would be my top choice. It's a G-Shock watch that I got from my father, it's actually the first prize that my father won from a lucky draws game, so to me the watch resemble luck and success. " 
+ ! Even though if your THINGS is a movie, then you shouldn;t use this structure, we'll be talking about this later in the note -> need another solution. 

+ ? For EXPERIENCE, also follow 
**Name:** fixing my first big bugs
**When**: 6 years ago
**Highlight**: Dopamint Rust and Enlightenment

`First Version:`
"One of the memorable moment in my life is when I've solving a major bugs while programming a blackjack game back in the 9th grade. Programming holds a special place in my hears and so does debugging. I incredibly content and amuse by the fact even if I don't know the answer now, I can always find it in the future. This though alone give me motivate to pursue my career in coding. Beside, the profound satisfaction I get after I solving a bug is truly rewarding.

+ ? For PLACES,
 **name:** library
 **what it's like:** spcious, quite
 **a highlight about it:** full of scholar and study motivation

+ ! But what if the topic was about COUNTRY like "Tell me about a Country that you want to visit the most" ? let's find the answer in Combine Model Subjects


### 2. Combine Model Subjects
![[Pasted image 20250531003650.png]]

In case where you can't apply the Model Subject, so make sure to prepare at least more than 1 Model Subject for each Topic -> More Flexible & Time Saving. 
![[Pasted image 20250531003855.png]]
+ $ The Main idea is to have a world of example of your own. Like playing D&D, you **already have the resource**, so you **just need to interact with it.** 

**pratice theme:** Describe a person you know who collects something.  
	PEOPLE combine with THINGS (Mr.Bean + Comics) ![[Pasted image 20250531004015.png]]
	
+ ? In summary, treat Speaking like playing D&D. Prepare all of your Subject in order to create your own Story (learn how to combine them together) -> erase the worry of running out of idea in the exam room.
