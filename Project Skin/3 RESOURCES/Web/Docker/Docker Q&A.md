**Fundamentals Questions**
+ **Explain in detail the roles of namespaces and cgroups in achieving container isolation.** Can you provide simple diagrams explaining their function?



**Workflow Integration and Orchestration**

- **Detail how Docker integrates into a CI/CD pipeline.** Can you provide an example pipeline with steps involving Docker for building, testing, and deployment?
- **What are the purposes of Docker Compose files, and how are they used in development and production settings?**
- **When does Docker Swarm or Kubernetes become necessary?** Briefly explain the situations where you would choose one over the other.



**Practical Usage**
+ **Walk me through the structure and commands in a typical Dockerfile for a moderately complex project.** What are some best practices to optimize Dockerfile design?
- **How does Docker networking function?** Can you explain how to link containers together, expose ports, and manage more advanced networking scenarios?
- **Discuss volume management in Docker.** When are volumes necessary, and how do they differ from persistent storage mechanisms?



**Security**
+ **Beyond basic isolation, what security considerations should I be aware of when using Docker extensively?**
