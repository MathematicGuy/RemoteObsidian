There case that text overflow, we can use [overflow attributes]([CSS Overflow (w3schools.com)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_overflow.asp)).
![[Pasted image 20231030101552.png]]
- `visible` - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
- `hidden` - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible

- `scroll` - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content

- `auto` - Similar to `scroll`, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary
