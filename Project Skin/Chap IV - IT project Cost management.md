PV, AC and EV relationship:
Ex:
+ Student fail to get credits in a semester. AC go up, EV (earned value) go down because he achieve less than he spend.
+ A company instead of employed 5 employees as planned. They only employ 2 employee making AC go down and EV go down.
-> So is AC and EV related to eachother? Depend on the situation (such as they are saving cost now to spend less in the future, They f-up something and the cost increase now but save cost in the latter unexpectedly) 
	but they both related to PV.
