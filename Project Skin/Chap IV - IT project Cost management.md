PV, AC and EV relationship:
Ex:
+ Student fail to get credits in a semester. AC go up, EV (earned value) go down because he achieve less than he spend.
+ A company instead of employed 5 employees as planned. They only employ 2 employee making AC go down and EV go down.
-> So is AC and EV related to eachother? Depend on the situation (such as they are saving cost now to spend less in the future, They f-up something and the cost increase now but save cost in the latter unexpectedly) 
	but they both related to PV. 

ETC (the leftover budget to finish the project)

EAC - Estimation cost At Completion
BAC -  Budget At Completion 
AC - Actual Cost
EV - Earned Value
fomular:
	EAC = AC + BAC – EV
	SPI = EV/PV (Schedule Performance Index)
	CPI = EV/AC (Cost Performance Index)
		check if EV > 1. Because Earned value must be close to actual cost or higher than AC for profit / index.

Cost Variance: Biến động chi phí CV = EV – AC
Schedule Variance: Biến động lịch trình SV = EV – PV 

#### EAC (Estimate cost at completion)
1) **IF CPI not alter for the rest of plan**
	+ EAC = BAC / CPI 
2) **If everything as plan*  
	+ EAC = AC + BAC - EV
3) **If the starter plan not compatible anymore.**  
	+ EAC = AC + ETC từ dưới lên
4) **If CPI and SPI both affect the rest of tasks** 
	+ EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI)]


PV = 40.000
EV = 35.000
AC = 38.000

Calculate CV, SV, CPI, SPI ?
	CV =  - 3000
	SV = - 5000 
	CPI = 0.921
	SPI = EV / PV = 0.875 (ko thuan loi)
Overbudget and Slow to plan


PV = 600
AC = 360

EV, CV, SV, CPI, SPI, EAC
	EV = 3/6 * 600 = 400
	CV = EV - AC = 40
	SV = EV - PV = - 200
	CPI = EV / AC = 1.1111111111 (Underbudget)
	SPI  = EV / PV = 0.6 (delay to plan)	
	EAC = 600 / 1.111 = 540
