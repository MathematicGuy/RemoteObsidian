**What is Unit Testing?**

- **Smallest Testable Parts:** Unit testing involves writing code to test the smallest individual pieces of your application â€“ usually these are functions or methods.
- **Isolation:** The idea is to test a unit in isolation from other parts of the codebase, ensuring that it behaves correctly on its own.
- **Early Bug Detection:** Unit tests help you catch potential errors in your logic at the very early stages of development, keeping them from cascading into larger problems.

**What Does a Unit Test Do?**

1. **Set Up:** A unit test often creates a small environment where the unit can run (e.g., providing sample data).
2. **Call the Unit:** The unit of code (like a function) is executed.
3. **Assertion:** The test checks if the output or behavior of the unit matches what is expected. The unit test will "pass" if everything works correctly, and "fail" if there's unexpected behavior.

**Example: A Function to Calculate Average Score**

You might have a function called `calculateAverageScore(scores)`, which takes a list of student scores as input. Here's what a unit test might look like:

Python

```
def test_calculate_average_score():
    sample_scores = [80, 90, 75]
    result = calculate_average_score(sample_scores)
    assert result == 81.67  # The test will pass if this is true 
```

**How Unit Tests Help Your Project**

- **Code Quality:** Unit tests encourage you to write modular code that's easy to test. This usually leads to better design and easier maintenance.
- **Confidence in Changes:** When you need to change code, unit tests act as a safety net, alerting you if you've accidentally broken existing functionality.
- **Specific Problem Identification:** Failing tests immediately pinpoint the area of code where a problem lies, making debugging faster.

**Specific Benefits for Your Code Evaluation Feature**

- **Accuracy Testing:** Write unit tests to make sure your code analysis logic correctly identifies errors, calculates complexity metrics, or provides the right feedback based on different code samples.
- **Edge Cases:** Unit tests can cover different coding scenarios (e.g., invalid code, code with specific edge cases), making sure your evaluation handles them gracefully.

**Tools:**

- .NET offers testing frameworks like NUnit, xUnit, or MSTest.
