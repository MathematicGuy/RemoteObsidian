### Language Mistakes to Avoid
A lot of German word sound English like when you say "Bekommen" it may associate you with the word "to become" but it actual meaning is "getting something". These are called "false friends", so pay attention. 

**"Ich bekomme ein Geschenk"** - i get a present 

Another **common mistake** people make are **prepositions.** In general, there are no general rules when it comes to this so it is up to your memory ?? (V2 - Word Order)
+ Dem Jungen gab ich einen Ball - I gave the boy a ball
	Some of you might thing it mean "The boy grab my balls" or "The boy gave I the ball". You see, it may have different meaning or ridiculously wrong.  

Alternate forms of "ch" - "ch" may sound different depending on what letter stand in front of it. If "i" or "e" stand before "ch" is make a hissing sound, like a cat. To produce this sound, touch your tougue to the roof of your mouth or your hard palatte. If `a, o, u` come in front makes a harsh noise at the back of your thoat.   

## [[German Nominative Case]]
> The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence—the person or thing performing the action.

**Example:**
+ **Der Hund** bellt. (The dog barks.)
	"Der Hund" is in the nominative case as it is the subject performing the action of barking.



## [[German Accusative Case]]
> The accusative case is used for the direct object of a sentence—the person or thing directly affected by the action.

**Example**
+ Er hat **den Ball**. (He has the ball.)
	"Den Ball" is in the accusative case as it is the direct object being affected by the action of having.



## [[German Dative Case]]
> The dative case is used for the indirect object of a sentence—the person or thing receiving the direct object.

**Example:**
+ Ich gebe **dem Kind** ein Buch. (I give the child a book.)
	"Dem Kind" is in the dative case as it is the indirect object receiving the book.



## [[German Gentitive Case]]
> The genitive case is used to indicate possession, similar to using "of" or the possessive "'s" in English.

**Example:**
- Das ist das Haus **des Mannes**. (That is the house of the man / That is the man's house.)
    - "Des Mannes" is in the genitive case, showing that the house belongs to the man.
