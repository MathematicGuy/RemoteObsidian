## [[German Nominative Case]]
> The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence—the person or thing performing the action.

**Example:**
+ **Der Hund** bellt. (The dog barks.)
	"Der Hund" is in the nominative case as it is the subject performing the action of barking.


## [[German Accusative Case]]
> The accusative case is used for the direct object of a sentence—the person or thing directly affected by the action.

**Example**
+ Er hat **den Ball**. (He has the ball.)
	"Den Ball" is in the accusative case as it is the direct object being affected by the action of having.


## [[German Dative Case]]
> The dative case is used for the indirect object of a sentence—the person or thing receiving the direct object.

**Example:**
+ Ich gebe **dem Kind** ein Buch. (I give the child a book.)
	"Dem Kind" is in the dative case as it is the indirect object receiving the book.


## [[German Gentitive Case]]
> The genitive case is used to indicate possession, similar to using "of" or the possessive "'s" in English.

**Example:**
- Das ist das Haus **des Mannes**. (That is the house of the man / That is the man's house.)
    - "Des Mannes" is in the genitive case, showing that the house belongs to the man.
