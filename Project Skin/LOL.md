5) Don't Force
> Don't rely on your team mate making them have to risk for you. 
+ ? Don't take all the damage, observe for oppotunities.
+ ? Make Champions use their skill then use your.

6) Don't Fight Fair and Speed Matter
> Lure Champions and Isolated them to their team by pushing roads,  then for the gank, which now give u a number advantage. 
+ ? Just pushing a side lane, and help your teammate.

7) When your teammate follow
+ If less numbers, run
+ If more numbers,  fight
+ If even, (don't force) do it slow, observe the situations then play.

8) Baron before inhibitors
> Riot make the game with the intention you have to take baron first before pushing.
+ ? You can either kill Baron or use it as Bait.


# Tempo
> The time you go farm golds and recall.

If you can time your movements you can stay ahead your enemy. Or predict your enemy movement by predict their tempo to ambush them. 

+ ? You only stay ahead because you have more Stuff not more money.

### Attacking Tempo
"If I can predict the enemy movement and kill them, where can I do it again ?"

If the enemy Jungle kill Dragon, can I steal their Jungle Buff and monsters ?
(This is map awareness)


### Defending Tempo
Questions to asked:
+ If I kill this things, would that thing be stoled or would I lose that. If I do this what will happened.

**Jungle Main Focus**:
+ **Early Game:** Farm Jungle > Gank/Crab > Finish Jungle > Focus on ganking Dragon Lane by getting blue buff first
+ **Mid Game:** 
	+ **Gank as much as you can** -> Create an advantage gap by putting presure on 1 lane. Especially dragon. 
	+ Measure time between dragon. Save health and skills for Dragon.
	
+ **Late Game:** Keep your health for Baron/Elder Dragon, try not to die. Late game live are more valuable than mid/early. 1 death can end the whole game.

**Attention:**
