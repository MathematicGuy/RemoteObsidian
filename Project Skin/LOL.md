**Jungle Main Focus**:
+ **Early Game:** Farm Jungle > Gank/Crab > Finish Jungle > Focus on ganking Dragon Lane by getting blue buff first
+ **Mid Game:** 
	+ **Gank as much as you can** -> Create an advantage gap by putting presure on 1 lane. Especially dragon. 
	+ Measure time between dragon. Save health and skills for Dragon.
	
+ **Late Game:** Keep your health for Baron/Elder Dragon, try not to die. Late game live are more valuable than mid/early. 1 death can end the whole game.

**Early Game:**
+ Dragon
+ Tower 
+ Kills
+ Jungle

**Mid Game**
+ Baron
+ Dragon
+ Tower

**End Game**
+ Tower (if "Elder Dragon" or "Baron" killed.)
+ Elder Dragon
+ Baron


**Attention:**
+ **Angle and Lane Position are utterly important** (**like chess**) but being ignore by many. There're angle where ADC can't shoot and nerfed, and angle where they performed best. Each champion have their angle, find that angle and you find the game.
	
+ Gank angle, Survive Angle for AD....
