An `enum` is a special "class" that represents a group of **constants** (unchangeable variables, like `final` variables).

Example:
Enum Class Location
```java
public enum Location {  
    INDOOR, OUTDOOR  
}
```
So you can only use 2 option: INDOOR or OUTDOOR 
```java
current_location = Location.OUTDOOR 
```
