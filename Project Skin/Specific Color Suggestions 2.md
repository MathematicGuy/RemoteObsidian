**General Refinement Principles**

- **Subtlety:** Elegance often lies in nuanced shifts rather than drastic changes.
- **Desaturation:** Slightly lowering the saturation of colors can add a touch of sophistication.
- **Warm/Cool Balance:** Consider introducing a hint of warmth or coolness for more interesting palettes.
