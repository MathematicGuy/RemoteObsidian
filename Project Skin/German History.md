Hitler Speech 28/7: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxUGlj6ogqk
### German after WW1
My grandparents were German and lived there until 2 years after WWII was under way. I know first hand what they suffered after WWI and the Treaty of Versailles did to the German people in their own country. Basically foreigners were given control of all banks, bakeries, and properties. Bread was 250 marks, but if you were a German citizen, they charged up to one trillion. They were starved, beaten and thrown out of their homes and farms. Factories, per the treaty, were given ownership to various surrounding countries. The factory my grandmother worked at as a young girl was given to the French. After about a year the French would take a train into the factory, take all they wanted, pull girls off the line and rape them in front of everyone. Because of the Treaty the government didn't dare even look into it. So yes, after a certain point, the German people have had enough. Propaganda will try to convince you to see someone or a situation in a way they want you to. In all things it's important to research both sides of the story. WWII didn't just happen over a whim of one man. To think that is preposterous.
