1. **Exam Setup:**
    
    - Instructors create exams with multiple questions (open-ended coding tasks, problem-solving with code snippets, etc.).
    - They set guidelines for both ChatGPT and human reviewers (what aspects to score, level of feedback detail).
    
2. **Candidate Takes Exam:**
    
    - The system presents questions and a code editor interface.
    - Candidates submit code solutions for each question.
    
3. **Automated Scoring (ChatGPT Stage)**
    
    - **Execution:** The system attempts to run the submitted code (with test cases if applicable).
    - **ChatGPT Analysis:** Submitted code is sent to ChatGPT with carefully crafted prompts that guide it to provide:
        
        - Functionality assessment (Does the code solve the problem?)
        - Efficiency suggestions (Are there simpler, more optimized approaches?)
        - Style & Readability Critique (Is the code well-organized, does it follow good practices?)
        
    
4. **Human Reviewer Stage:**
    
    - Reviewers access submitted code alongside ChatGPT-generated analysis.
    - They use interface tools to add ratings based on pre-defined criteria (correctness, time complexity, special focus areas).
    - Reviewer input:
        
        - Confirm or amend ChatGPT feedback
        - Offer more tailored suggestions specific to the candidate's skills or common pitfalls
        
    
5. **Score Presentation & Feedback:**
    
    - System compiles a final score based on automated scores and human input.
    - This is presented to the candidate with both ChatGPT's initial feedback and the reviewer's annotations.
