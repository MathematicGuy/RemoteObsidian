**1. Initiation**

- **Project Charter:** Formal document outlining the project's reason, goals, scope, stakeholders, and constraints.
- **Stakeholder Analysis:** Identify individuals or groups that impact or are impacted by the project, determining their influence and interests.
- **Feasibility Study:** Assess the project's viability â€“ technical hurdles, market need, and financial implications.

**2. Planning**

- **Detailed Scope Statement:** Clearly define what the project will and will not deliver.
- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Break down tasks into manageable chunks.
- **Project Schedule:** Create a timeline outlining task dependencies and milestones.
- **Budgeting:** Estimate costs for labor, materials, equipment, etc.
- **Communication Plan:** How you'll collaborate with the team and report progress to stakeholders.
- **Risk Management Plan:** Identify, analyze, and develop responses to potential risks.

**3. Execution**

- **Task Assignment:** Ensure the team members understand their roles and responsibilities.
- **Progress Monitoring:** Track performance against the schedule and budget.
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensure project deliverables meet defined standards.
- **Change Management:** Implement a process to handle any required adjustments to the project plan.
- **Team Management:** Motivate, facilitate communication, and resolve conflicts within the team.

**4. Monitoring & Control**

- **Regular Status Reporting:** Track progress against the plan and report to stakeholders.
- **Variance Analysis:** Analyze any deviations from the schedule, budget, or scope.
- **Corrective Action:** If necessary, implement course corrections to ensure the project stays on track.
- **Risk Monitoring:** Continually assess and update the risk management plan.

**5. Closure**

- **Final Deliverables:** Ensure completion and acceptance by the client or stakeholders.
- **Lessons Learned Review** What went well? What could be improved? Document knowledge for future projects.
- **Project Archive:** Store project documentation for future reference.
- **Formal Closure:** Obtain confirmation of the project's successful completion.

**Why This Life Cycle Works for IT Projects**

- **Structure:** Provides a clear and logical roadmap.
- **Adaptable:** Can be scaled for projects of varying size and complexity.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Includes steps focused on planning for and managing potential risks.
- **Emphasis on Communication:** Highlights the importance of stakeholder communication at all phases.


**Agile Methodologies**

**Understanding Agile**

Agile emphasizes flexibility, iterative development, and continuous customer feedback. Scrum offers a framework within Agile that uses fixed-length 'Sprints' for incremental delivery.

**Agile Adaptation of the Life Cycle**

2. **Initiation:** Similar to the traditional approach, but often less detailed upfront:
    
    - **Product Vision:** Clear statement of the product's ultimate purpose.
    - **Product Backlog:** Prioritized list of features and requirements (changes often).
    - **Initial High-Level Roadmap:** Approximate longer-term timeline for release goals.
    
4. **Sprint Planning (Replaces in-depth upfront planning):**
    
    - **Sprint Goal:** Focus for the short, finite duration of the Sprint.
    - **Select Backlog Items:** Team agrees on what they can commit to in the Sprint.
    - **Task Breakdown:** Team creates tasks to achieve the Sprint's goal.
    
6. **Sprint Execution (Iterative Development):**
    
    - **Sprints (Typically 2-4 weeks):** Time-boxed cycles of intense focus.
    - **Daily Scrums:** Brief standup meetings for team coordination and problem-solving.
    - **Work-in-Progress:** Focus on completing the selected backlog items for the Sprint.
    
8. **Sprint Review & Retrospective (Monitoring & Control in bursts):**
    
    - **Sprint Review:** The team showcases working output to stakeholders, seeking feedback.
    - **Sprint Retrospective:** The team examines its process and collaboration, seeking continuous improvement.
    
10. **Product Release (Closure, but Repeatable):**
    
    - **Potentially Shippable Increment:** Usable portion of the product is ready for release if desired.
    - **Adapting Backlog:** New insights and feedback refine the backlog for future Sprints.
    - **Repeat: ** Sprints continue until the product reaches its ideal form or is no longer viable.
    

**Key Differences in an Agile/Scrum Approach**

- **Less Defined End:** Continuous refinement, not working towards a single grand outcome.
- **Flexible Scope:** Focus on delivering the most valuable features first, not rigid requirements.
- **Empowered Teams:** Project managers become facilitators, teams decide how to accomplish goals.
- **Fast Feedback:** Sprints ensure regular checks on value being created and course correction.

**Benefits for IT Projects**

- **Faster value delivery:** Usable software features become available sooner.
- **Adapting to Change:** Better suited for uncertain requirements or shifting technology trends.
- **Collaboration boost:** Communication emphasized within the team and with stakeholders.
