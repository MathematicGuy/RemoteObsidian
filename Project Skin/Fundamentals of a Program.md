C is a Higher Level Programming Languages
> Make it easier to write programs
+ Opposite of assembly.
+ Describe actions in a more abstract form.
+ Don't need to worry about the precise step the CPU would have to take to accomplish a particular task.
+ The Instrucions (statement) look like problem solving.
> You have to compile C to Machine Language (Assembly). So that the CPU can understand.

Steps in writing a program
1) Define Goals (Program Objective)
2) Design 
	+ Decide how the program will met the above requirement
	+ User interface
	+ How the program should be Organize
3) Write the Code
	+ Start Implementation.
	+ use an IDE
4) Compile -> translate to Machine code
	Consists of detailed instructions to the CPU expressed in a numeric code.
5) Run the Program
6) Test & Debug
	Check your code. Finding and Fixing program errors
7) Maintain and Modify the Program
	Upload Program online
	Fix new bugs or Add new features
Note:
+ Don't directly go writing code
+ The Larger and Complexer the program is, the more planning it requires.
+ Pls Develop habit of planning before coding.

### Overview
C Creator is Dennis Ritchie
C can write all sort of application
+ Pointers play a big role in C
**Advantages**
+ Efficiency
+ Portability
+ Flexibility
+ Programmer Oriented

**Diadvantages** 
+ Flexibility and Freedom also requires added responsibility
	+ Use of pointer is problematic and abused
	+ Can make errors that are difficult to trace
+ Sometimes because of its wealth of operators and its conciseness, it makes the language difficult to read and follow
	+ Code may cause obscure without a deeply understanding.
