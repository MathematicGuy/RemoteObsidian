[How to negotiate at venture capital](https://www.openvc.app/blog/how-to-negotiate-with-vcs)
- **How much you raise and how much % you’re willing to give away matters.** For example, if you’re expecting a $100M post-money valuation but only raising $1M (and therefore only willing to give away 1% of your company), you’ll disqualify yourself from being considered by many VCs (even if they think the valuation is reasonable) because they would expect to own ~10% or more. Keep this in mind when answering the precious “how much are you raising?” question from VCs.
