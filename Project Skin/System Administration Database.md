breaching data: in-structure data

--- 
Đặt chỉ mục (như trong Từ Điển) -> search A, found Acronym, Account, Apple, etc.. search B -> Bible, Barbie, Bubble, etc..

Server (
+ run 24/24,
+ static IP address (address create 1, use forever)
)

Local (
+ run only turn on,
+ dynamic IP address (change whenever my Laptop turn on/off)
)


DDL (data definition lanaguage)
DML (data manipulation language)
DCL (data controll language)
	Decentralize Permission, add clients to server

+ Decentralize editing and deletion rights
	3 admin, but hold different rights
		Ex:
		+ Sales DB manager, Social DB manager - only able to edit, delete, add to some allow permission table.
		+ admin - have every right.


DB Architecture
	Centralized DBMS 
	Client/Server
	Three-Tier Client/Server
		Save Data on 2 DB. 
		1 hold all data
		1 hold just the needed data
		+ ? Why? For security. The main DB only give out the necessary data![[Pasted image 20240226144851.png]]

API (Application Program Interface)

Redis (DBSM dạng key-value) - (recommended)
	run on RAM -> faster speed 

Document Oriented -> MongoDB
GraphDB
