come along with me And the butterflies and bees

We can wantder through the forest 
And do so as we please
![[Pasted image 20240118155952.png]]

To a cliff under a tree
Where we can gaze upon the water
**CHANGE**
![[Pasted image 20240119190348.png]]

As an everlasting dream
All of my collection
![[Pasted image 20240119190442.png]]

I'll share them all with you
Maybe by next summer
We won't have changed our tunes
![[Pasted image 20240119190619.png]]


We still want to be 
With the butterflies with bees
![[Pasted image 20240119190824.png]]

Making up new numbers
And living so merily
All of my collections
![[Pasted image 20240119190833.png]]

I'll share them all with you
I'll be here for you always
![[Pasted image 20240119190919.png]]

And always be with you
Come along with me
And the butterflies and bees
