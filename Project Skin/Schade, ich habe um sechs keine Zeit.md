Why Zeit was put at the last of the sentence ?
+ ? `"keine Zeit um Sechs"` and `"um Sechs keine Zeit"` is both grammatically correct. However placing Zeit at the end emphasized their lack of availability. It draws attention to he speaker's unavailaibility at the specified time.
	
	The choice of word order can subtly change the emphais or focus of the sentence 

+ ? `"Keine"` vs `"Kein"` The used of word `depend on the gender and case of the noun being negated`
	
	`Zeit` is a `feminine noun` and it being used in the `accusative case` since it follow thes the preposition `"um"`). Therefor `"keine Zeit"` is the correct form to negate the noun `"Zeit"`
