**Motivation #1: Solving Real-World Problems**

- **"Works on My Machine" Syndrome Vanishes:** Projects with complex setups often break when moving between environments (your laptop, a classmate's, or university servers). Docker erases this problem, ensuring your work runs consistently.

- **Project Collaboration Made Easy:** Work with teams seamlessly. Everyone pulls the same Docker image, guaranteeing a shared development environment â€“ a huge headache saver!

- **Explore Cutting-Edge Tech:** Many companies build on microservices and cloud infrastructure, where Docker knowledge is indispensable. Getting familiar now gives you a head start.
