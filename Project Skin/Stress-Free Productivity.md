# Part 1: Self-Observation
## CHAPTER 1: You Are the Solution, Not the Problem
+ ? Who am I  to Give You This Advice
	The Author draw points from many areas of psychological research to help me understand hwo my thoughts, behaviours and emotions interact. **Hint: your emotion is not your weekness**

+ $ The Approach we take together
	Often come from my Original Thinking, not comming from copying other people productivity habit or structures. 
	We'll harness that self knowledge and creativity to create your  own personal model for productivity
	+ @ End Game Goal is to uncover how I can be my most:
		Growth-Oriented
		Efficiency and Effective
		Creative and Visionary
	+ ? The reason for this triple focus is:
		1. Without grow-oriented, you'll be too likely to put off by hard thing
			
		2. You wont get anywhere close to freedom if I'am creative but don't find successful, efficient processes you can exploit through repetition.
			
		3. On the other hand, your achievements will be limited if you're good at executing and self-organized but stay on a narrow path. To perfor optimally, you need to focus deliberately on being creative and innovation.

+ ? How I defind productivity
	Achieve more with doing less

 
+ $ Success is Not Purely About Being More Focused
	Time-Management and habits are small part in productive, lemme explain:
	**Why consistant habit is overated ?**
		**The Benefits:** Habit keep thing persistant, reduce uneccessary decision fatige 
		**The Cost:**
		+ It can make your life flow like a blur. And they're lack of Innovation
		+ Being too habit-bound can reduce how often have the novel experience essential to your productivity.
	-> If you have no desire to be a flowlessly self-desciplined robot, that healty. This book tell an enjoyable path to greater productivity is being more human, not more robotic or habit-bound.

+ ? Why Wasting time is fine:
	Reduced happiness is not an acceptable side effect of efficiency.


Discipline and Performance go down -> Creativity go up
+ ? This is because effieciency and undistracted happend when you know exactly or most of what you going to do.
+ $ Creativity happened when sth new was created from ideas. This mean you're converging many ideas into one. And yes it will take times and work which can be done instead.
	+ However Creativity is the only way one can evolve and continue to growth. (True story: I found a method to increase my work flow more nearly 100% at times I was pushed to the edge)
+ @ Therefor, focusing more on consistencies can make u miss out new oppotunities, interests and relationships.
