	e.g. US decrease Vietnam tariff for Vietnam to decrease US tariff as well.

**Competitive or Distributive negotiation (đàm phán cạnh tranh hoặc phân phối)** -> **Win-Lose**
>This type rotate around the allocation of finite resources, where the success of one party implies the loss of the other.   

**Collaborative negotiation (đàm phán hợp tác)** aim for -> **Win-Win**

**Negotiation by compromise (đàm phán theo thỏa hiệp)** -> both parties accept losses to achieve a middle ground.
>This involves **parties striving for equitable agreements through mutual concesions.** It entails an intermediate level of cooperation and compromise to attain a middle ground.  

**Avoidant negotiation** -> evades a forsees unprofit negotiation.  
> Marked by a desire to evade conflicts and challenging situations, often by to postpone or altogether avoiding (hoàn toàn né tránh) the negotiation process. It is employed when *it is deemed* (đc coi là) more advantagous to *forego* (từ bỏ) negotiation, as there is an *anticipation (mong đợi)* of no benefit from reaching an agreement. (vì có sự dự đoán rằng sẽ không có lợi ích từ việc đạt được thỏa thuận) 



**Multilatera negotiation (đàm phán đa phương)** - involve three or more nations negotiating simultaneously to reach an agreement acceptable for all participants.

## Negotiation Outcome (result)
**Negotiation by Compromise (Win-Loss Negotiation or Zero-Sum game)**: a situation where one player's gain is exactly another player's loss. 
-> Convert Win-Loss situation into a Win-Win situation.

**Loss-Loss Negotiation**: result in 0 win, mayber negative. 
-> Duh, **no one Win**. Small win rather than Loss, *a Loss is a Loss, even when their loss is bigger than your*. **Aim for a Compromise, even how small it is.**
