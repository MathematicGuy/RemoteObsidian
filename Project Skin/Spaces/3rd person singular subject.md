- **er** (he) for masculine nouns
- **sie** (she) for feminine nouns
- **es** (it) for neuter nouns

These pronouns are used to refer to a single person, animal, object, or concept. When a verb is conjugated to match a third person singular subject, it usually ends in "-t."

Let's look at how the verb "arbeiten" is conjugated:

1. **Ich arbeite** (I work) - first person singular
2. **Du arbeitest** (You work) - second person singular
