**What is a Database?**

- **Organized Collection:** A database is a structured way to store and manage large amounts of data for easy access, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Real-World Examples:** Think of a database as a sophisticated filing cabinet. Examples include:
	Library Book Record 
	Youtube Watch History
	Shopee Product Inventory


**What is a Database Administration System (DAS)?**

- **Software Management Tool:** A Database Administration System (DAS), also known as a Database Management System (DBMS), is specialized software that lets you interact with databases. This includes creating, updating, and maintaining databases, as well as ensuring their security and performance.
- **Popular Systems:**
    - **Relational:** Oracle Database, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL
    - **Non-Relational (NoSQL):** MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis

#### **Why are Databases Important?**

- **Centralized Storage:** Provides a single point of truth, streamlining data access across a business or organization.
	Store organize related data. 
- **Data Consistency:** Enforce rules for how data is entered and managed, reducing errors and improving reliability.
- **Decision Making Insights:** Analyze large amounts of stored data using reporting and querying tools to identify trends and patterns.
- **Security and Access Control:** DASs come with features to protect sensitive data, and granularly control who can access and modify that data.
	Be aware of who accessing sensitive datas

#### **Key Duties of a Database Administrator (DBA)**

1. **Data Modeling and Database Design:**
    
    - Creating the logical structure (schema) of databases for optimal organization and efficiency.
    
2. **Database Installation and Configuration:**
    
    - Setting up new database instances and tailoring configurations for specific requirements.
    
3. **Performance Tuning and Optimization:**
    
    - Ensuring databases run smoothly by identifying bottlenecks, adjusting settings, and optimizing how databases process information (queries).
    
4. **Backup and Recovery:**
    
    - Implementing measures to protect data and devising strategies to restore databases if unforeseen data loss occurs.
    
5. **Security Management:**
    
    - Controlling user access, setting permissions, and safeguarding databases from unauthorized access, leaks, or cyberattacks.
    
6. **Troubleshooting:**
    
    - Solving database errors, performance issues, and supporting users and applications that interact with the database.
    
7. **Staying Updated:**
    
    - Tracking new trends, technologies, and evolving best practices in the world of database administration.
 
#### DB v/s DBSM
Database - Contain datas not but cannot manipulate or manage.
	Can just Read 
DBSM - Allow administrates contents for multi-purposes
	Read/Write/Update/Delete

**How to Begin Learning Database Administration**

2. **Start Simple:** Familiarize yourself with database fundamentals and relational/non-relational databases. SQL is a critical first step.
4. **Choose a System:** Pick a popular DBMS (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) for practice.
6. **Install and Set Up:** Download and experiment with locally hosted databases.
8. **Tutorials & Resources:** Find a wide array of online courses and guides to build your skills.
10. **Practice:** Create sample databases, add data, write SQL, and learn how to design and optimize databases.
