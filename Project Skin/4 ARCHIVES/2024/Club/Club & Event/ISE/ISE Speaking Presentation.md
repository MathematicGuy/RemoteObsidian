## Breaking the language barrier | Tim Doner |

##### "Knowing a language is a lot more than knowing a couple words out of the dictionary"


Create a link between word

memorize lyric, rap, singing.

exprimented.

associate object you see to creata a sentence.

Interaction

getting exposor, make phrase out of your imagination.

Learn language by cultural.

Take a guess of the sentences before searching for it. You can understand the word, but not the meaning.

## Why We Struggle Learning Languages.
##### "If you want to learn a language efficiently, then you need to give that language life."

- You remember better with impression. Create a story for the sentence, word. 
- Twerk your way into the language system. 
- Find the rule within the language

##### “Learning another language is not only learning different words for the same things, but learning another way to think about things.”

**3 simple rules:**
1. Find one person to talk with, a conversation partner 
2. No english rule with this person, only language that you are learning
3. Start speaking :)

Force yourself only speaking 1 language
-> Make the most frequence word being over used.  


## Use Word for learning pronunciation

## Create a Learning Environment

+ Time Section

## Advice: 

+ Fun fact: *You can train your brain to respond to a song in a certain way! If you put this on and do your hardest to study, and do nothing else while it is on (pausing when you need to take breaks, even if it is just for a minute) your brain will enter study mode automatically when it hears the sound!*
	It takes a while to build the association but it is super powerful, and ADHD brains respond to that training really, really well.

+ *If u already awake, don't drink coffee in the morning*. 
	Reason: Make you too pro-active bc so much ideas blow in your head that u can't control.



## Don’t imitate in the third person.
+ *A Language can only be learn effectively if you understand what you are learning*
+ You should never think about grammer, If you do,  this might cause you to develop the habit of thinking about grammar when having real conversation.

Don't Focus on the documents, enjoying it naturally so when you putting in a similiar condition you'll get use to it cause you heard it so many times, mimicking it so many time. 

Try finding the right type of input, mimicking it and enjoy it.
