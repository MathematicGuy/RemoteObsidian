1/11/ 2024: C practice
+ revision array and printf data type long - %ld, short - %hd .
+ practice working with pointer (a lot), string library, file, error handling.
+ bitwise and bitshift practice and understand. covert all 1 to 0 and 0 to 1 from the 3rd bit.
+ convert decimal to binary using itoa library.
+ understand hight byte -> all bit from the 8th position from right to left. 
+ understand malloc -> * pa   = (data_type * )  malloc (n * (data_type));
	n mean number of element get memory allocate. Ex: I need to allocate 4 element in 4 address -> use malloc
	2D array (2x2) ->  * pa   = (data_type * )  malloc (( n * n ) * (data_type));
