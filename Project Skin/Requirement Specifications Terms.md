**Core Requirements**

- **UC ID and Name:**
    - **UC ID:** A unique identifier for the use case (e.g., UC001)
    - **Name:** A concise description of what the user will achieve (e.g., "Submit Order")
    
- **Created By:** The author who defined this use case.
	
- **Primary Actor:** The main user/system interacting with the software to perform this use case.
	
- **Trigger:** The event that starts the use case (e.g., User clicks "Checkout").
	
- **Description:** A brief overview of the use case's purpose and functionality.
	
- **Preconditions:** Conditions that _must_ be true before the use case begins (e.g., User must be logged in).
	
- **Postconditions:** The expected state of the system after the use case completes successfully (e.g. Order is placed).
	
- **Normal Flow:** The primary sequence of steps the user and system take to complete the task.
	
- **Alternative Flows:** Different paths the use case can take based on choices or specific conditions.
	
- **Exceptions:** Error scenarios or unexpected events, and how the system should handle them.

**Prioritization & Context**

- **Priority:** How critical the use case is in meeting overall project goals (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
	
- **Frequency of Use:** How often the use case is expected to be performed (e.g., Daily, Weekly).
	
- **Business Rules:** Constraints, policies, or regulations that govern this use case.
	
- **Other Information:** Additional relevant details, like screen mockups or related use cases.
	
- **Assumptions:** Things taken for granted to be true. It's important to list them to uncover potential risks.

**Why Do These Matter?**

A well-structured functional description creates a shared understanding between all stakeholders. Specifically:

- **Developers:** Get precise instructions on what to build.
	
- **Testers:** Design test cases that cover all possible scenarios including errors.
	
- **Project Managers:** Can track progress and ensure resources are allocated effectively to high-priority use cases.
	
- **Clients/Users:** Understand what functionality to expect from the system.
