#### Basic German Accusative Structure 
```ad-info
**Subject** (Nominative) + **Verb** + **Direct Object** (Accusative) + **Other elements** (optional)
```
**Example:**
+ **Ich** (I) **esse** (eat) **den** (an) **Apfel** (apple) 

**How this differs from English:**

- **Word Order Flexibility:** German has more flexible word order, allowing for some variation in the placement of "Other elements" within the sentence. English tends to have stricter word order rules.
    
- **Article Changes:** While English articles ("the", "a/an") mostly don't change, the German equivalent will adjust depending on the accusative case (e.g., "der" becomes "den").


**Factors Triggering the Accusative Case:**

- #Direct_Object: The noun, pronoun, or phrase directly receiving the action of the verb is in the accusative.
    
    - "Der Hund trinkt **das Wasser**." (The dog drinks the water.)
    
- #Certain_Prepositions: Prepositions like "für" (for), "durch" (through), "um" (around), and others signal the accusative case on the object they govern.
    
    - "Ich fahre **durch den Tunnel**." (I drive through the tunnel.)
    
+ #Time_Expressions: Expressions of time durations usually go in the accusative.
    
    - "Wir bleiben **einen Monat**." (We are staying for one month).

Ex:
+ I love you > Ich liebe dich (not "du")
+ you love me > Du liebst mich (not "ich")
+ I love him > Ich liebe Ihn (not "er")
+ I love her/them > Ich liebe sie.
	I have a group of friends, ich liebe sie.
	We've been married for 3 years, ich liebe sie.
