+ To build programs with C#, you need the .NET platform

+ **.NET comes in two major flavors, .NET Framework for Windows and .NET Core for Windows/MacOS/Linux**
	+ NET Framework is the original version of .NET that only runs on Windows computers.
	  
	+ NET Core is the new, cross-platform version of .NET that can runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux.
		Conveniently, [Microsoft itself plans to rename .NET Core to .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/) towards the end of 2020.
