# Build Web Apps with ASP.NET

+ To build programs with C#, you need the .NET platform

+ **.NET comes in two major flavors, .NET Framework for Windows and .NET Core for Windows/MacOS/Linux**
	+ NET Framework is the original version of .NET that only runs on Windows computers.
	  
	+ NET Core is the new, cross-platform version of .NET that can runs on Windows, MacOS, Linux.
		Conveniently, [Microsoft itself plans to rename .NET Core to .NET](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/) towards the end of 2020.

+ **.NET is a platform and ASP.NET a framework**
	To build programs like web apps and web services, you need the ASP.NET framework on top of .NET

API (Application Programming Interface)

### Web API vs Web MVC (they're different)

+ Web APIs
	+ **The Middleman:** Think of a Web API as a bridge between different software applications. It's like a **set of rules and instructions that allow one application to request data or services from another**, regardless of the technology they're built with.
	+ **Data Focused:** Web APIs primarily deal with structured data, usually in formats like JSON or XML. They don't directly create fancy web pages to look at.
		  
	+ **Example:** Imagine a weather app. It needs up-to-date weather data. A Web API can let it communicate with a weather service to get the latest temperature, forecast, and other information.



+ Web MVC Model  
	- **Model:** Represents the data of your application (e.g., a customer's profile, a product in a store). It **handles data storage and retrieval logic.**
		
	- **View:** Responsible for how the data is presented to the user (e.g., **the HTML, CSS, and visual structure of a webpage**).
		
	- **Controller:** The brain that handles user requests. **It takes user input, interacts with the Model to get or update data, and tells the View how to display the results.**
		
	+ **Example:** Let's say you have an online store. The product listings, individual product pages, and shopping cart are all examples of Views. The Controller handles actions like adding a product to the cart or searching for items. The Model manages product information in the database
