# Focus
---

Where do I need to focus? Where are the things that I need to be aware of? What do I want to do with my life? What are the roles, activities, aspirations that define me? What's the legacy I want to leave?

What is listed in my [[Command N]]? What are the things I want to create to leave a dent in this world?

I can only anser this by asking myself Đinh Nhật Thành the [[Seven W's]]

1. [[Who]] am I?
2. What do I [[Want]]?
3. [[Why]] I am doing this?
4. [[When]] I'm going to do these?
5. [[What]] are the things I will consistently to do accomplish these?
6. With [[Whom]] I'm going to surround myself for leverage.
7. [[Where]] will I do this; which tools will I use?

It won't hurt to review my [[Principles]] from time to time

And I pray and thank those who [[assist me]], the [[everyone I'm grateful for]] and with God for everything unasked I have.
